Description
	
Indica rice seedlings of IR64 variety were grown hydroponically for 7-days in a culture room with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 14h light and 10h dark. Seedlings were incubated in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (control) or 50 micromolar solutions of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA treatment) and benzyl aminopurine (BAP treatment) for 1h and 3h. Equal amounts of 1h and 3h samoles were pooled for each treatment before RNA isolation. The 5 micrograms of each total RNA sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Experiment Overall Design: Two biological replicates for each sample (control, IAA treated, BAP treated) were used for microarray analysis. The experiment involves the identification of differentially expressed genes in IAA and BAP treated samples as compared to control.

Description
	
Obesity is becoming increasingly widespread in developed countries, and is often associated with heart diseases and diabetes. Elevated levels of plasma free fatty acids are a biochemical hallmark of obesity. Unlike plants and bacteria, mammals cannot utilize fatty acids to generate glucose because of the lack of glyoxylate shunt enzymes. Instead, fatty acids are used for energy storage, and their utilization is regulated at multiple levels ranging from hormonal to metabolic ensuring that glucose is preferentially oxidized before fatty acids. Here we designed a synthetic gene-metabolic circuit to alter the intracellular signaling and metabolic pathways that control fatty acid metabolism. By introducing the Escherichia coli glyoxylate shunt enzymes, isocitrate lyase (AceA) and malate synthase (AceB), into the mitochondria of human hepatocytes, we demonstrated that fatty acid utilization is preferentially increased while glucose uptake is significantly reduced. This bacterial pathway diverts signal metabolites (citrate, acetyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA) that inhibits fatty acid uptake and provides an additional channel for fatty acid utilization. Remarkably, the hepatocytes readily adapted to the synthetic circuit by a series of global transcriptional and post-translational changes in metabolic and signal transduction pathways that further advanced our design objective. This systems approach illustrates the logic of the synergistic interaction between metabolism and signal transduction. The ready acceptance of this non-native pathway by hepatocytes suggests the plasticity of liver metabolism and opens a possibility for the synthetic approach in regulating human metabolism. Experiment Overall Design: Wild type (WT) human hepatocyte HepG2 and HepG2 cells stably transfected with pBudaceAB (designated ACE), a vector containing isocitrate lyase and malate synthase from E. coli, were analyzed after 24hour exposure to palmitate. Cells were seeded at 70% confluency in 10cm plates with DMEM growth media augmented with 300uM palmitate. After 24hours, total RNA was harvested and hybrized to Affymetrix HG_U133A 2.0 GeneChips. Data was processed using GCOS 1.2 software. Experiment Overall Design: 2 WT biological replicates and 2 ACE biological replicates were analyzed. Experiment Overall Design:

Description
	
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common paediatric soft-tissue; sarcoma and resembles developing skeletal muscle. Specific genomic ; alterations including translocations, deletions and amplification events ; have been associated with the alveolar and embryonal subtypes of RMS. Characterizing these changes has led to increased understanding of the ; underlying molecular biology. However, further aberrations and their ; significance remain to be defined. Genomic copy number variations have ; been shown to affect the level of transcription in several tumor types. In ; this study, we have combined array comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 13 RMS cell lines, supported by confirmatory PCR analyses, with their corresponding expression profiles. This identified sets of genes that are altered in their level of expression by genomic imbalances. We also show that the effect on gene expression was proportional to the level of genomic gain or loss. Experiment Overall Design: will be added later on

Description
	
Effective toxicological testing of the vast number of new and existing chemicals currently in use will require efficient and cost effective methods. We evaluated the utility of a simple, low cost toxicity testing system employing the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to identify toxicologically relevant changes in gene expression. Dichlorvos and fenamiphos, which are organophosphorous pesticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase were chosen as model toxicants to test the usefulness of the C. elegans toxicity testing system, and mefloquine, which appears to perturb neuronal Ca++ homeostasis, provided an out-group for analysis. Experiment Overall Design: Concentrations of dichlorvos, fenamiphos, or mefloquine sufficient to prevent the development of 10%, 50%, or 90% of mid-vulval L4 worms to the early gravid adult stage at 24 h after exposure were determined in range finding experiments. For definitive experiments, mid-vulval L4 worms were exposed to one of the foregoing concentrations of dichlorvos, fenamiphos, or mefloquine for 8h. Exposures were performed in triplicate.

Description
	
Homozygous mutation of the murine retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene, Rb, results in embryonic lethality between E13.5 and E15.5 with defects in cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Many of these defects are suppressed by mutation of an activating E2F, E2f1 or E2f3, indicating that they are key downstream targets of the retinoblastoma protein, pRB. In this study, we assess how E2F4 contributes to the developmental consequences of pRb-loss. In stark contrast to the activating E2Fs, the homozygous mutation of E2f4 shortened the lifespan of Rb-/- embryos. This resulted from an exacerbation of the placental defect of the Rb-/- mice indicating that E2F4 and pRB cooperate in the development of this tissue. Further analyses indicated that this defect reflects an increase in trophectoderm-like cells. Under conditions where the placenta was wild-type but the embryo mutant for E2f4 and pRb embryos survived to birth and exhibited all of the defects that were observed in the E2f4 and Rb single mutant embryos. Thus, while pRB and E2F4 cooperate in placental development, they play largely non-overlapping roles the development of many embryonic tissues. Experiment Overall Design: In one experiment, embryonic Day 13.5 placentas from wild-type and Rb -/- knock-out mice were compared. In the second experiment, embronic day 11.5 placentas from wild-type and Rb -/-;E2f4 -/- double knock-out mice were compared.

Description
	
In most embryos, the mid-blastula transition is a complex process featuring maternal RNA degradation, cell cycle pause, zygotic transcriptional activation and morphological changes. The nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio has been proposed to control the multiple events at MBT. To understand the global transcriptional response to the changes of the N/C ratio, we profiled wild type and haploid embryos using cDNA microarrays at three developmental stages. Experiment Overall Design: For the diploid transcriptional profile, we prepared cDNA from hand selected wild-type embryos at cycle 13 interphase (15min after the nuclear division of cycle 12) and at early and late cycle 14 interphase (15min and 40 min after the nuclear division of cycle 13), respectively. For the haploid, cDNA was prepared from cycle 14 embryos (15min after the nuclear division of cycle 13) and early and late cycle 15 embryos (15min and 40 minutes after the nuclear division of cycle 14). The collection was designed in this way so that each cell cycle stage of the diploid has a counterpart stage with matched N/C ratio in the haploid (e.g. cycle 13 in the diploid has the same N/C ratio as cycle 14 in the haploid). In all experiments, the cell cycle progression was monitored by the Histone-GFP pattern. Triplicates of about 50 embryos each with right age were collected for each time point.

Description
	
Glycinebetaine-induced water-stress tolerance in codA-expressing transgenic indica rice is associated with up-regulation of several stress responsive genes. Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a non-accumulator of glycinebetaine (GB), is highly susceptible to abiotic stress. Transgenic rice with chloroplast-targeted choline oxidase encoded by the codA gene from Arthrobacter globiformis has been evaluated for inheritance of transgene up to R5 generation and water-stress tolerance. During seedling, vegetative and reproductive stages, transgenic plants could maintain higher activity of photosystem II and they show better physiological performance, e.g. enhanced detoxification of reactive oxygen species compared to wild-type plants under water-stress. Survival rate and agronomic performance of transgenic plants is also better than wild-type following prolonged water-stress. Choline oxidase converts choline into glycinebetaine and H2O2 in a single step. It is possible that H2O2 /GB might activate stress response pathways and prepare transgenic plants to mitigate stress. To check this possibility, microarray-based transcriptome analysis of transgenic rice has been done. It unraveled altered expression of many genes involved in stress responses, signal transduction, gene regulation, hormone signaling and cellular metabolism. Overall, 165 genes show more than 2 folds up-regulation at P value <0.01 in transgenic rice. Out of these, at least 50 genes are known to be involved in plant stress response. Exogenous application of H2O2 or GB to wild-type plants also induces such genes. Our data show that metabolic engineering for GB is a promising strategy for introducing stress tolerance in crop plants and which could be imparted, in part, by H2O2- and/or GB-induced stress response genes. Experiment Overall Design: Rice (Oryza sativa L.), transgenic plants expressing codA gene from Arthrobacter globiformis were compared with untransformed plants at seedling level

Description
	
CD8 T cells play a crucial role in immunity to infection and cancer. They are maintained in constant numbers, but upon stimulation with antigen undergo a developmental program characterized by distinct phases encompassing the expansion and then contraction of antigen-specific populations, followed by the persistence of long-lived memory cells. Although this predictable pattern of a CD8 T cell response is well established, the underlying cellular mechanisms regulating the transition to memory remain undefined. Here we show that TRAF6, an adapter protein in the TNF-receptor (TNFR) and IL-1R/TLR superfamily, regulates CD8 T cell memory development following infection by modulating fatty acid metabolism. We show that mice with a T cell-specific deletion of TRAF6 mount robust primary CD8 T cell effector responses, but have a profound defect in their ability to generate memory. This defect is CD8 T cell intrinsic and is characterized by the disappearance of antigen-specific cells in the weeks following primary immunization. Microarray analyses revealed that TRAF6-deficient CD8 T cells from early timepoints following immunization exhibit altered expression of genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism. Consistent with this, activated CD8 T cells lacking TRAF6 are unable to upregulate mitochondrial -oxidation in response to growth factor withdrawal in vitro. Treatment with drugs that induce fatty acid oxidation enabled CD8 T cell memory generation in the absence of TRAF6. Remarkably, these treatments also increased CD8 T cell memory in wild type mice, and consequently were able to significantly improve the efficacy of an experimental anti-cancer vaccine. Experiment Overall Design: CD8 T cells from two mouse strains (OTI-WT and OTI-TRAF6 knockout) at two timepoints (6d with 3 replicates and 10d with 5 replicates) after infection are used.

Description
	
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is genetically characterized by the presence of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation in approximately 90% of cases. In contrast to FL carrying the t(14;18), their t(14;18)-negative counterparts are less well studied regarding their immunohistochemical, genetic, molecular and clinical features. Within a previously published series of 184 FL grade 1-3A with available gene expression data, we identified 17 FL lacking the t(14;18). Comparative genomic hybridization and high resolution SNP array profiling demonstrated that gains/amplifications of the BCL2 gene locus in 18q were restricted to the t(14;18)-positive FL subgroup. A comparison of gene expression profiles revealed an enrichment of germinal center B-cell associated signatures in t(14;18)-positive FL, whereas activated B-cell like, NF B, proliferation and bystander cell signatures were enriched in t(14;18)-negative FL. These findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry in an independent validation series of 84 FL, in which 32% of t(14;18)-negative FL showed weak or absent CD10 expression and 91% an increased Ki67 proliferation rate. Although overall survival did not differ between FL with and without t(14;18), our findings suggest distinct molecular features of t(14;18)-negative FL. Experiment Overall Design: Fresh-frozen tumor-biopsy specimens were obtained from 184 untreated patients who had received a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. RNA was extracted from the biopsy specimens and was examined for gene expression with the use of Affymetrix U133A and U133B microarrays.

Description
	
To identify a novel target for the treatment of heart failure, we examined gene expression in the failing heart. Among the genes analyzed, 12/15 lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) was markedly up-regulated in heart failure. To determine whether increased expression of 12/15-LOX causes heart failure, we established transgenic mice that overexpressed 12/15-LOX in cardiomyocytes. Echocardiography showed that 12/15-LOX transgenic mice developed systolic dysfunction. Cardiac fibrosis increased in 12/15-LOX transgenic mice with advancing age, and was associated with the infiltration of macrophages. Consistent with these observations, cardiac expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) was up-regulated in 12/15-LOX transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Treatment with 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenotic acid, a major metabolite of 12/15-LOX, increased MCP-1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells, but not in cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of Mcp-1 reduced the infiltration of macrophages into the myocardium and prevented both systolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis in 12/15-LOX transgenic mice. Likewise, disruption of 12/15-LOX significantly reduced cardiac Mcp-1 expression and macrophage infiltration, thereby improving systolic dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload. Our results suggest that cardiac 12/15-LOX is involved in the development of heart failure and that inhibition of 12/15-LOX could be a novel treatment for this condition. Experiment Overall Design: Heart failure is still one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of heart failure and develop more effective treatments for this condition. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of heart failure, we performed microarray analysis using cardiac tissue samples obtained from a hypertensive heart failure model (Dahl salt-sensitive rats). ~300 genes showed significant changes of expression in the failing hearts compared with control hearts. Among the genes analyzed, 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) was most markedly up-regulated in failing hearts compared with control hearts .

Description
	
Uncontrolled mitosis forms basis for tumor cell proliferation. Interference with normal mitotic progression often leads tumor cells to mitotic arrest. As a consequence, cell death follows, but not at all time. Reasonably, the antimitotic therapy has been proven effective and indispensable in the clinical treatment of cancer.Recently, we generated a 6H-Pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c] isoquinolin -5(6H)-one library, several products of which had been shown to possess antimitotic activities in vitro. In an attempt to understand the antitumor mechanism of these novel chemicals, we have chosen one bioactive product of this library, MT7, as a model compound in this study; We used microarrays to detail the kinetics of gene expression in HeLa cells in a time course of MT7 treatment (from 1.5 h to 12 h). The gene expression profiles were further analyzed by GSEA and Connectivity Map, respectively. Experiment Overall Design: HeLa cells growing on the 10-cm dishes were treated with 5 mM MT7 for 0(control), 1.5(Time1), 3(Time2), 6(Time3) and 12(Time4) hours, respectively. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and the total RNA was isolated and processed for Affymetrix U133A 2.0 hybridizations.

Description
	
This study examined the effects of castration and testosterone replacement on global differential gene transcription in the gastrocnemius muscle (m.Gas) in young adult mice over 14-days. Experiment Overall Design: Each of the 3 treatment groups was composed of 3 independent biological replicates, totaling 9 arrays. Equal amounts of the highest quality total RNA (4 g) from three animals were pooled for each biological replicate, totaling the use of 27 animals in the 9-array experiment. The balanced design of this study enabled the use of a 1-way ANOVA, which was used to statistically determine which of the >34,000 genes (>45,000 probes) were differentially expressed between groups. The three pair-wise comparisons were: Castration vs. Sham (castration (C) effect); Testosterone vs. Castration (testosterone replacement (T) effect); and Testosterone vs. Sham (overall effects).

Description
	
Benidipine hydrochloride is a long-acting calcium channel blocker and is used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. The cardioprotective effects of benidipine have been shown in several animal and clinical studies. We examined the effect of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) benidipine on the gene expression profile in heart by DNA microarray. Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats were fed with normal diet (0.19% NaCl) or a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age. Benidipine (4mg/kg) or vehicle (0.5% w/v methylcellulose 400cP) was administered orally after the start of the feeding. DS rats fed the high-salt diet showed an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP), which was accompanied by the gain of heart weight. SBP was significantly lower in the benidipine group than in the vehicle group. The weight of heart was significantly decreased in the benidipine group. Experiment Overall Design: Three samples were analyzed, the hearts of rat with normal diet (normal), high-salt diet plus vehicle (control), high-salt diet plus Benidipine (Benidipine). We use 2 arrays: control vs. normal and Benidipine vs. control. Replicates and dye swaps were not performed.

Description
	
Lambs that inherit a callipyge allele from their dam have an up-regulation of maternally imprinted transcripts near the callipyge mutation but do not exhibit muscle hypertrophy. It is not clear what effects these maternally expressed transcripts have in the muscle or how the inheritance of a maternal callipyge allele prevents the expression of the callipyge phenotype which is seen paternal heterozygotes only. This experiment utilized bovine gene expression arrays to profile the gene expression of the semimembranosus muscle of 30 day old half-sibling lambs of all four possible genotypes with respect to the callipyge allele (+/+, C/+, +/C, and C/C). Experiment Overall Design: 10 lambs were used for this study. N=3 biological reps for C/C genotype, N=3 biological reps for Cmat/+ genotype, N=2 biological reps for +/Cpat genotype, and N=2 biological reps for +/+ genotype. Pairwise contrasts were performed to analyze the presence of a maternally inherited callipyge allele and the effect on a homozygous animal (+/C vs CC; +/+ vs C/+; and C/+ vs C/C). Experiment Overall Design: These data make up two experiments. Experiment Overall Design: [1] The maternal allele (4 genotype) experiment compares all four possible genotypes of a particular allele at one age and one tissue (30 days semimembranosus). Experiment Overall Design: [2] The paternal allele (2 genotype) experiment compares only the NC and the NN genotypes in one tissue (SM) across 4 ages (10, 20, 30, and 80 days). Experiment Overall Design: Images were interpreted with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS5.0) in GCOS with no scaling or normalization (i.e., Samples GSM298143-GSM298164). Images were also interpreted by RMA using Bioconductor package of R (i.e., Samples GSM298165-GSM298186).

Description
	
Brain metastasis is one of the most feared complications of cancer and the most common intracranial malignancy in adults. Its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. From breast cancer patients with metastatic disease we isolated cell populations that aggressively colonize the brain. Transcriptomic analysis of these cells yielded overlapping gene sets whose expression is selectively associated with brain metastasis. The expression of seventeen of these genes in primary breast tumors is associated with brain relapse in breast cancer patients. Some of these genes are also associated with metastasis to lung but not to liver, bone or lymph nodes, providing a molecular basis for the long-observed link between brain and lung metastasis. Among the functionally validated brain metastasis genes, the cyclooxigenase COX-2, the EGFR ligand HB-EGF, and the brain-specific 2-6 sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC5 mediate cancer cell passage through the blood-brain barrier. Other brain metastasis genes encode inflammatory factors and brain-specific proteolytic regulators, suggesting a multifaceted program for breast cancer colonization of the brain. Experiment Overall Design: 204 primary tumors from breast cancer patients with known site of relapse were studied, focussing on brain relapse versus other relapse. Identified genes were validated in this cohort.

Description
	
A long form (tRNase ZL) of tRNA 3' processing endoribonuclease (tRNase Z, or 3' tRNase) can cleave any target RNA at any desired site under the direction of artificial small guide RNA (sgRNA). We discovered in human kidney 293 cell extracts various new small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) including 5'-half-tRNAs and 28S rRNA fragments, co-immunoprecipitated with tRNase ZL, and demonstrated that two of these ncRNAs work as sgRNAs for tRNase ZL in vivo as well as in vitro. In order to find genuine mRNA targets of tRNase ZL guided by ncRNAs, we performed DNA microarray analysis for mRNAs from the 293 cells transfected with the tRNase ZL expression plasmid, and found that PPM1F and DYNC1H1 mRNAs are its genuine targets. Experiment Overall Design: In order to find genuine mRNA targets of tRNase ZL guided by ncRNAs, we performed DNA microarray analysis for mRNAs from the 293 cells transfected with the tRNase ZL expression plasmid.

Description
	
Because of inherent differences between deceased donor (DD) and living donor (LD) liver grafts, we hypothesize that the molecular signatures will be unique, correlating with specific biologic pathways and clinical patterns. Following reperfusion, 579 genes in DD grafts and 1324 genes in LDs were differentially expressed (p<0.005). Many up-regulated LD genes were related to regeneration, biosynthesis and cell cycle, and a large number of down-regulated genes were linked to hepatic metabolism and energy pathways correlating with post-transplant clinical laboratory findings. There was significant up-regulation of inflammatory/immune genes in both DD and LD, each with a distinct pattern. Gene expression patterns of select genes associated with inflammation and regeneration in LD and DD grafts correlated with protein expression. Unique patterns of early gene expression are seen in LD and DD liver grafts, correlating with protein expression and clinical results, demonstrating distinct inflammatory profiles and significant down-regulation of metabolic pathways in LD grafts. Experiment Overall Design: Microarray profiles of 63 biopsies in 13 DD and 8 LD liver grafts done at serial time points (procurement - No Manipulation, backbench - Cold Preservation, and 1-hour post-reperfusion - Post reperfusion) were compared between groups using class comparisons, network and biological function analyses. Specific genes were validated by quantitative PCR and immunopathology. Clinical findings were also compared.

Description
	
An important question for the use of the mouse as a model for studying human disease is the degree of functional conservation of genetic control pathways from human to mouse. The human placenta and mouse placenta show structural similarities but there has been no systematic attempt to assess their molecular similarities or differences. We built a comprehensive database of protein and microarray data for the highly vascular exchange region micro-dissected from the human and mouse placenta near-term. Abnormalities in this region are associated with two of the most common and serious complications of human pregnancy, maternal preeclampsia (PE) and fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), each disorder affecting ~5% of all pregnancies. To compare the gene expression patterns in the vascular exchange regions of the human (villus tree) and mouse (labyrinth) placenta. Experiment Overall Design: Mouse labyrinth tissue was micro-dissected form naturally mated crosses of C57Bl/6J mice. Placentas were individually dissected on embryonic day 17.5. From each litter of the tissue were set aside for RNA extraction and microarray analysis and for cellular fractionation and proteomic analysis, as recently described (Kislinger et al., 2006). Human villous trees were dissected from term normal placenta delivered by cesarean section from a term pregnancy (~ 38 weeks). Tissue was divided for organellar fractionation and RNA extraction.

Description
	
Ovarian granulosa cells play a central role in steroidogenesis, which is critical for female reproduction. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) promotes cAMP mediated signaling to regulate granulosa cell steroidogenesis. We have shown previously that 2, 2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1, 1, 1-trichloroethane (HPTE) inhibits FSH- and dibutyryl cAMP-stimulated steroidogenesis, and affects the mRNA levels of steroidogenic pathway enzymes in rat granulosa cells. However, HPTE showed a differential effect in FSH- and cAMP-stimulated cells in that HPTE more completely blocked FSH- when compared to cAMP-driven steroidogenesis. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of HPTE on global gene expression profiles in untreated granulosa cells and those challenged with FSH or cAMP. Granulosa cells from immature rats were cultured with 0, 1, 5, or 10 M HPTE in the presence and absence of either 3 ng FSH/ml or 1 mM cAMP for 48 h. Total RNA was isolated for microarray analysis using the GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 and ArrayAssist Microarray Suite. An investigation of changes in gene expression across all HPTE treatments showed that HPTE altered more genes in FSH- (~670 genes) than in cAMP-stimulated cells (~366 genes). Analysis confirmed that HPTE more effectively inhibited FSH- than cAMP-induced steroid pathway gene expression and steroidogenesis. Furthermore, expression patterns of novel genes regulating signal transduction, transport, cell cycle, adhesion, differentiation, motility and growth, apoptosis, development, and metabolism were all altered by HPTE. This study further established that HPTE exerts differential effects within the granulosa cell steroidogenic pathway, and revealed that these effects include broader changes in gene expression. Experiment Overall Design: Ovaries were dissected from immature (21-27 days old), Sprague-Dawley rats and were placed into ice cold Ham s F12 medium. Granulosa cells were isolated from ovaries free of fat pads and surrounding connective tissue by performing non-enzymatic needle puncture method . Following two washes by centrifugation at 1400rpm/250xg for 5 min at 4 C , the cells were plated and cultured at approximately 3-4x105 viable cells/mL/well in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 5% FCS at 37 C in 5% CO2 in a 24-well culture plate for 24 hours. The cells were then cultured in serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 0.1 M androstenedione as a substrate for aromatization into E2. Experiment Overall Design: Cells were treated in triplicate with increasing doses of HPTE (0, 1, 5, and 10 M) in the absence (basal) or presence of 3 ng FSH/ml or 1 mM cAMP for 48 h. The doses of FSH and cAMP were selected based on a dose-response curve that provided a maximum level of stimulation for E2 production (data not shown). Similar doses of HPTE were previously used (Zachow and Uzumcu, 2006). Cultures were terminated at 48 h following the addition of treatments. Experiment Overall Design: Cell lysate was collected for total RNA isolation for DNA microarray analysis. Total RNA were extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat # 74106) followed by DNase I treatment. RNA qualities were assessed by electrophoresis using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and spectrophotometric analysis prior to cDNA synthesis. Forty nanograms of total RNA from each sample was used to generate a high fidelity cDNA for array hybridization using NuGen Ovation Biotin RNA Amplification and Labeling system (NuGen, Cat#2300-60). After fragmentation and biotin labeling, the samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays. Washing and staining of all arrays were carried out in the Affymetrix fluidics module as per the manufacturer s protocol. The detection and quantization of target hybridization was performed with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner. Data were assessed for array performance prior to analysis and analyzed using ArrayAssist (Stratagene).

Experiment Overall Design: Pairs of normal and tumor tissue samples were obtained at the time of surgery from resected pancreas of 36 pancreatic cancer patients. Gene expression was analyzed on Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 whole genome microarrays. For three of the 36 normal-tumor sample pairs we carried out replicate microarray hybridizations in order to gauge the technical measurement errors. We thus performed 78 genechip hybridizations in total. A patient sample pair was excluded from further analysis since one of the samples did not meet the quality controls. The microarray data was subsequently normalized using the RMA algorithm.

Description
	
Nucleotide polymorphisms can potentially influence the hybridization of mRNA to 25-mer oligonucleotides. Because Affymetrix Rice Genome Array was designated mainly for Nipponbare genome of Oryza sativa, the expression level of other varieties could not be estimated correctly. We tried to apply new approaches to estimate expression level by discerning the probe-level differential hybridization. Experiment Overall Design: Nipponbare and 93-11 replicates were analyzed.

Description
	
Advanced ovarian cancers are initially responsive to chemotherapy with platinum drugs but develop drug resistance in most cases. We showed recently that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) enhances death of human ovarian cancer cell lines treated with cisplatin (CDDP) and that this effect is mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In this work, we integrated genome-wide expression profiling, in silico data survey, and functional assays to identify transcripts regulated in SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells made more responsive to CDDP by HGF. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we found that HGF pretreatment changes the transcriptional response to CDDP. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR not only validated all the 15 most differentially expressed genes but also confirmed that they were primarily modulated by the combined treatment with HGF and CDDP and reversed by suppressing p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Among the differentially expressed genes, we focused functional analysis on two regulatory subunits of the protein phosphatase 2A, which were down-modulated by HGF plus CDDP. Decrease of each subunit by RNA interference made ovarian cancer cells more responsive to CDDP, mimicking the effect of HGF. In conclusion, we show that HGF and CDDP modulate transcription in ovarian cancer cells and that this transcriptional response is involved in apoptosis regulation. We also provide the proof-of-concept that the identified genes might be targeted to either increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutics or revert chemotherapy resistance. Experiment Overall Design: Two of the time-course experiments, done independently Experiment Overall Design: (TR5 and TR7), were analyzed. Experiment Overall Design: time 0 (h0) Experiment Overall Design: time 6 hours (h6) Experiment Overall Design: time 12 hours (h12) Experiment Overall Design: time 24 hours (h24) Experiment Overall Design: with (hgf1) and without addition of HGF (hgf0)

Description
	
Understanding how the expression of transcription factor (TF) genes is modulated is essential for reconstructing gene regulatory networks. There is increasing evidence that sequences other than upstream noncoding can contribute to modulating gene expression, but how frequently they do so remains unclear. Here, we investigated the regulation of TFs expressed in a tissue-enriched manner in Arabidopsis roots. For 61 TFs, we created GFP reporter constructs driven by each TF's upstream noncoding sequence (including the 5'UTR) fused to the GFP reporter gene alone or together with the TF's coding sequence. We compared the visually detectable GFP patterns with endogenous mRNA expression patterns, as defined by a genome-wide microarray root expression map. Experiment Overall Design: To obtain a comprehensive non-overlapping root expression map which would be compared with promoter GFP fusion lines by imaging, we identified three cell type specific GFP marker lines and profiled transcripts in selected cell types using a cell sorting-microarray technique.

Description
	
Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) feeding on Arabidopsis thaliana induces a defense response, quantified as reduced aphid progeny production, in infested leaves but not in other parts of the plant. Similarly, infiltration of aphid saliva into Arabidopsis leaves causes only a local increase in aphid resistance. Further characterization of the defense-eliciting salivary components indicates that Arabidopsis recognizes a proteinaceous elicitor with a size between 3 to 10 kD. Genetic analysis using well-characterized Arabidopsis mutant shows that saliva-induced resistance against M. persicae is independent of the known defense signaling pathways involving salicylic acid, jasmonate, and ethylene. Among 78 Arabidopsis genes that were induced by aphid saliva infiltration, 52 had been identified previously as aphid-induced, but few are responsive to the well-known plant defense signaling molecules salicylic acid and jasmonate. Quantitative PCR analysis confirms expression of saliva-induced genes. In particular, expression of a set of O-methyltransferases, which may be involved in the synthesis of aphid-repellent glucosinolates, was significantly up-regulated by both M. persicae feeding and treatment with aphid saliva. However, this did not correlate with increased production of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, suggesting that aphid salivary components trigger an Arabidopsis defense response that is independent of this aphid-deterrent glucosinolate. Experiment Overall Design: 3 biological replicates (control and treatment). Total number of samples: 6.

Description
	
Effector cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be generated by in vitro stimulation of na ve or memory subsets of CD8+ T cells. While the characteristics of CD8+ T cell subsets are well defined, the heritable influence of those populations on their effector cell progeny is not well understood. We studied effector cells generated from na ve or central memory CD8+ T cells and found that they retained distinct gene expression signatures and developmental programs. Effector cells derived from central memory cells tended to retain their CD62L+ phenotype, but also to acquire KLRG1, an indicator of cellular senescence. In contrast, the effector cell progeny of na ve cells displayed reduced terminal differentiation, and, following infusion, they displayed greater expansion, cytokine production, and tumor destruction. These data indicate that effector cells retain a gene expression imprint conferred by their na ve or central memory progenitors, and they suggest a strategy for enhancing cancer immunotherapy. Experiment Overall Design: Effector cells were generated from naive or central memory CD8+ T cells. The cells were then rested (unstimulated) or restimulated (stimulated). This experimental design resulted in 4 groups (Na ve-derived/stimulated, Na ve-derived/unstimulated, Central memory-derived/stimulated, Central memory-derived/unstimulated). Three replicates from independent experiments were analyzed.

Description
	
Setleis Syndrome is a rare type of facial ectodermal dysplasia characterized by an aged leonine appearance with puckered skin about the eyes, absent eyelashes on both lids or multiple rows on the upper lids and none on the lower lids, eyebrows that slant sharply upward laterally, and a rubbery feel of the nose and chin. Some of the patients showed bilateral temporal marks superficially like forceps marks and like the lesions seen in focal facial dermal dysplasia. We have evidence that Setleis Syndrome is caused by nonsense mutations in the gene coding for the small bHLH transcription factor known as TWIST2 in Puerto Rican and Omani patients. We performed expression microarray analysis of RNA samples derived from skin fibroblasts grown from skin biopsies of Setleis Syndrome patients and normal controls in order to identify genes potentially involved in facial development and the pathogenesis of Setleis Syndrome. Experiment Overall Design: A total of 4 control and 4 Setleis Syndrome RNA samples were hybridized to U133 plus 2 Affymetrix 3'IVT arrays in the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Microarray Core Facility.

Description
	
Activation of the Ras/Erk pathway upregulates expression of the Kruppel-like Factor 5 (KLF5) transcription factor, and KLF5 is a downstream mediator of Ras oncogenic signaling. Specifically, in bladder and colon cancer cell lines KLF5 upregulates the Ras-pathway target gene cyclin D1, and facilitates entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Ras mutations are common in lung cancer, but a role for KLF5 in lung tumorigenesis has not been defined. To this end, we manipulated KLF5 expression in four Ras-mutant human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to find that KLF5 significantly modulates anchorage-independent growth, a mutant Ras phenotype. However, in a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma, K-RasG12D does not critically require Klf5 to mediate oncogenesis or induce cyclin D1 expression. Patients with lung tumors expressing high levels of KLF5 have significantly better prognosis than those with low or no KLF5 expression (opposite of mutant Ras prognosis). The latter may be explained by KLF5 transcriptional repression of the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2 (ABCG2), an anthracycline transporter. In agreement with this, KLF5 knockdown cells display significantly more Hoechst side population and resistance to doxorubicin. In summary, while KLF5 is not an obligate partner in Ras oncogenic signaling, KLF5 control of ABCG2 expression is significant to patient survival. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted from H441 cells transduced with KLF5-specific shRNA (KD), KLF5 over expression (OE) and MSCV empty vertor (NT) respectively. The cRNAs was then hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix) according to manufacturer s protocol.

Description
	
Chromatin architectural protein NSBP1/HMGN5 belongs to the family of HMGN proteins which specifically interact with nucleosomes via Nucleosome Binding Domain, unfold chromatin and affect transcription. Mouse NSBP1 is a new and uncharacterized member of HMGN protein family. NSBP1 is a nuclear protein which is localized to euchromatin, binds to linker histone H1 and unfolds chromatin. We analyzed the effect of altered expression levels of mouse NSBP1 protein on global gene expression profile in AtT20 pituitary cells. We found that NSBP1 modulates the fidelity of cellular transcription in the nucleosome binding-dependent manner. Experiment Overall Design: Stable clones overexpressing wild type mouse NSBP1 protein or mutated NSBP1SE protein which does not bind to nucleosomes were generated by retroviral infection of AtT20 cells. siRNA treatment was applied to down regulate NSBP1 in the cells. Total RNA was collected from biological triplicates and analyzed by Affymetrix expression arrays.

Pulmonary hypertension is a frequent consequence of left heart disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) and causes extensive lung vascular remodelling which leads to right ventricular failure. Functional genomics underlying this structural remodelling are unknown but present potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression underlying vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Experiment Overall Design: Control rat lung samples were compared to samples of aortic banding rat lungs which exhibit pulmonary hypertension

Description
	
Tumor hypoxia is relevant for tumor growth, metabolism and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We report that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment induced mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in a dimetyl- -benzantracene induced mammary rat adenocarcinoma model, and the MET was associated with extensive coordinated gene expression changes and less aggressive tumors. One group of tumor bearing rats was exposed to HBO (2 bar, pO2 = 2 bar, 4 exposures 90 minutes), whereas the control group was housed under normal atmosphere (1 bar, pO2 = 0.2 bar). Treatment effects were determined by assessment of tumor growth, tumor vascularisation, tumor cell proliferation, cell death, collagen fibrils and gene expression profile. Tumor growth was significantly reduced (~16%) after HBO treatment compared to day 1 levels, whereas control tumors increased almost 100 % in volume. Significant decreases in tumor cell proliferation, tumor blood vessels and collagen fibrils, together with an increase in cell death, are consistent with tumor growth reduction and tumor stroma influence after hyperoxic treatment. Gene expression profiling showed that HBO induced MET with coordinated expression of gene modules involved in cell junctions and attachments together with a shift towards non-tumorigenic metabolism. This leads to more differentiated and less aggressive tumors, and indicates that oxygen per se might be an important factor in the switches of EMT and MET in vivo. HBO treatment also attenuated tumor growth and changed tumor stroma, by targeting the vascular system, having anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects.

Description
	
Chromosome 5A of wheat is a major regulator of freezing tolerance. It harbours gene loci controlling freezing tolerance (Fr-A1 and Fr-A2) and vernalization requirement (Vrn-A1). The number of cold-responsive genes and their functional classification was studied by cDNA macroarray-based transcript profiling in the moderately freezing-sensitive wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety Chinese Spring and two derived chromosome 5A substitution lines exhibiting lower or higher levels of freezing tolerance, respectively. During 21-days of cold acclimation at 2 C the transcript level changed significantly for 681 (6.6%) out of 10,297 studied unigenes. The freezing-tolerant substitution line exhibited about 1.5-fold higher number of differentially expressed genes compared to the sensitive one. Transcript levels of several genes were altered by cold treatment only in one of the three genotypes. For 78 genes regulation by factors hosted on chromosome 5A was determined and postulated. These genes encoded proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, defence processes and carbohydrate metabolism. Three of the chromosome 5A-affected genes, having especially strong and rapid cold-induced changes of transcript level, namely Tacr7 (Triticum aesticum cold-responsive gene 7 homolog), Cab (Ca2+-binding), and Dem (deficient embryo and meristems) were genetically mapped and characterized in further detail. Only the gene Cab was located on chromosome 5A, whereas Tacr7 and Dem resided on other chromosomes. Although chromosome 5A-affected genes are also found to be localised on the same chromosome, the present findings indicate that chromosome 5A is strongly involved in trans-regulation of genes potentially due to the presence of regulatory loci, like Fr-A2, which is harboring numerous CBF transcription factors.

Description
	
Four cultures (four biological replicates) of each of two strains, wild type H37Rv and a deletion mutant for mce3R gene, were grown in in Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80, or Middlebrook 7H11, supplemented with albumin 0.5%, dextrose 0.4%, and 0.5% glycerol (M7H9-AD-G).
Total RNA was extracted from each culture, dyed with Cy5 and hybridised onto two separated microarrays (technical duplicates).
In the second channel a mix of genomic DNA from strains H37Rv and AF2122 was dyed with CY3 and used as a common control in all the microarrays.
An statistical analysis of microarray data was performed to detect genes with differential expression between genotypes.

Description
	
Rsf1p is a putative transcription factor required for efficient growth using glycerol as sole carbon source but not for growth on the alternative respiratory carbon source ethanol. We use microarrays to determine the differences in the transcriptional program between the delta-rsf1 mutant and the wild type during respiratory growth on glycerol as well as the transition to growth on glycerol as sole carbon source. Experiment Overall Design: delta-rsf1or the isogenic parent strain were grown to early log (A600=0.6) in YPD and then washed twice in prewarmed YPG (30 C) and returned to the air shaker in YPG for 15, 30 or 60 minutes. "Limit" conditions were provided by harvesting cells grown in YPD to early log phase without shifting to YPG and by harvesting cells grown in YPG to early log phase. Since the delta-rsf1 mutant and its isogenic parent strain grow equally well on the respiratory carbon source ethanol, cells were also harvested after being grown in ethanol to early log phase.

Description
	
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis is an important signaling pathway in the growth and survival of many cell types and has been implicated in multiple aspects of cancer progression from tumorigenesis to metastasis. The multiple roles of IGF signaling in cancer suggest that selective inhibition of the pathway might yield clinically effective therapeutics. Here we describe A-928605, a novel small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for IGF signal transduction. This small molecule is able to abrogate activation of the pathway as shown by effects on the target and downstream effectors and is shown to be effective at inhibiting the proliferation of an oncogene addicted tumor model cell line (CD8-IGF1R 3T3) both in vitro and in vivo. Experiment Overall Design: CD8-IGF1R 3T3 cells and 3T3 Vector control treated for 24 h with vehicle or IGF1R inhibitor A-928605, all with 3 replicates.

Description
	
In each cell type the expression of genes is regulated by the action of a large number of transcription factors, but so far we have only a rudimentary knowledge of the location of the gene regulatory elements where they bind. This can now be addressed with genome-wide ChIP experiments. In a previous ChIP-chip study of USF1 and USF2 we found evidence also of binding of GABP, FOXA2 and HNF4a within the enriched regions. Here we have applied ChIP-seq for these transcription factors and identified 3064 peaks of enrichment for GABP, 7266 for FOXA2 and 18783 for HNF4a. HNF4a and FOXA2 binding was found in at least half of the regions previously identified as bound by USF2 but not USF1, showing that they frequently bind the same regulatory elements. GABP peaks were found at transcription start sites whereas 94 % of FOXA2 and 90 % of HNF4a peaks were located at other positions. We developed a method based on the high resolution achieved by ChIP-seq to accurately define TFBS within peaks, and found the predicted sites to have an elevated conservation level compared to peak centers; however the majority of bindings were not evolutionary conserved. An unexpected interaction between HNF4a and GABP was seen at TSS, with as many as 1/3 of the HNF4a positive promoters being bound also by GABP, and co-immunoprecipitations show that these factors are in the same complex in the nucleus.

Description
	
To provide a more detailed survey of adaptive changes in the physiology of P. aeruginosa (PA) during long-term infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, we performed a comparative proteome and transcriptome analysis of a set of isogenic sequential non-mutator and mutator isolates from three selected CF patients. Recently, we showed that during CF lung persistence PA mutators converge to a virulence-attenuated phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that besides virulence-associated traits (VATs) the adaptation process of PA predominantly comprises metabolic pathways. In end-stage mutator strains, transcripts of genes encoding VATs, chemotaxis, degradation of aromatic compounds and several two-component regulatory systems were decreased. In contrast, several transcripts of genes or proteins involved in metabolism of fatty acids, nucleotides, amino acids and the generation of energy were increased. Of particular interest is the increased expression level of genes involved in (i) the anaerobic arginine-deiminase pathway, (ii) the anaerobic respiration such as nitrate-uptake protein OprF, redox-active azurin and cytchrome c551 peroxidase, (iii) the micro-aerobic respiration such as high oxygen-affinity cytochrome oxidase cbb3 (iv) the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), glyoxylate shunt and anaplerotic carboxylation reactions to oxaloacetate. Strikingly, an increased transcription of the anaerobic regulator gene anr correlates with the up-regulation of ANR-dependent genes. In conclusion, these changes in transcriptome and proteome indicate an adaptive shift towards constitutive expression of genes of metabolic pathways obviously required for growth under micro-aerobic and nutritional conditions of suppurative CF lung tissue. Finally, these results provide us with new targets for antimicrobial agents and biomarkers reflecting adaptation of PA towards progressive CF lung disease. Experiment Overall Design: P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from different time points of chronic cystic fibrosis lung disease were cultered in vitro, harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared the transcriptome (triplicate microarrays) of early non-mutator P. aeruginosa isolates with late mutator isolates with high mutation frequency probably the driving force of an efficient adaptation to changing environements to conclude from differences in gene expression to the requirements of CF lung environment. Experiment Overall Design: Second publication of array data to be added later

Description
	
This study compares a cell line (MDA-MB-468GFP-LN) that aggressively metastasizes to lymph nodes to its parental line MDA-MB-468GFP. Derivation of the lines is described in Vantyghem et al, Clinical & Experimental Metastasis (2005) 22: 351 361. The goal here was to compare the gene expression profile of MDA-MB-468GFP-LN to MDA-MB-468GFP, Compare differential expression to databases of genes known to be involved in either cancer stem cell identification or lymph node specific metastasis in large scale clinical studies, and to confirm genes by RT-PCR Experiment Overall Design: For each cell line, 3 biological replicates were grown, RNA isolated, and gene expression profiles determined using Affymetrix HGU133_Plus_2 genechips. The MDA-MB-468GFP-LN cell line was the "experimental" group, and the MDA-MB-468GFP was the control group. Intensity values were calculated using MAS5.0, Data was then imported into Genespring 7.0, and ANOVA (nominal alpha set to 0.05) was used to determine probe sets showing significant differential expression. A Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm was implemented in Genespring to reduce the false discovery rate.

Description
	
The Rad23/Rad4 protein complex plays a major role in DNA damage recognition during nucleotide excision repair (NER) in yeast. We recently showed that two distinct pathways contribute to efficient NER in yeast. The first operates independently of de novo protein synthesis and requires a nonproteolytic function of the 19S regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome and Rad23. The second pathway requires de novo protein synthesis, and relies on the activity of a newly identified E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates Rad4 in response to UV. Surprisingly, we found that cells deleted of either Rad23 or Rad4 caused reduced Rad4 and Rad23 mRNA levels respectively. We considered the possibility of an unexpected role of Rad23 and Rad4 in regulating the expression of genes involved in the transcriptional response to DNA damage. Gene expression profiling has suggested that Rad23 and Rad4 may function as a complex to affect transcription of a small subset of genes in response to UV damage. To determine how Rad4 and Rad23 contribute to the regulation of these genes, we have examined the occupancy of Rad4/Rad23 in their promoter regions by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), both in the presence and absence of UV damage. Our preliminary ChIP data suggests that the Rad4/Rad23 complex regulates a set of genes in response to UV light. Experiment Overall Design: We perform arrays on Rad4 single, Rad23 single and Rad4/23 double mutants. Each set has 3 biological repeats. All samples are untreated, mRNA prepared from logarithmically growing cultures.

Description
	
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is essential for the stability and the function of many client proteins, such as ERB2, C-RAF, CDK4, HIF-1 aplha and AKT. Recent reports demonstrated that inhibition of Hsp90 modulates multiple functions required for survival of human cancer, such as myeloma (Mitsiades et al, Blood:107, 1092, 2006), The aim of this study is evaluate the effect of Hsp90 inhibition, and to identify molecular pathways responsible for anti-proliferative effect on ATL cells. For Hsp90 inhibition, Geldanamycin derivates, 17AAG (17-allylamino -17-demethoxygeldanamycin) and 17DMAG (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino) 17-demethoxygeldanamycin) were used in this study. Interleukin 2-independent ATL cell lines (MT-2 and MT-4) and an interleukin 2-dependent ATL cell line (TaY-E10) were incubated, with or without Hsp90 inhibitors. Experiment Overall Design: Three ATL cell lines(TaY-E10, MT-2, and MT-4) were cultured in the presence or absence of Hsp90 inhibitors(17-AAG and 17-DMAG).

Description
	
The Cohesin apparatus has a canonical role in sister chromatid cohesion. Heterozygous mutations in Nipped B-like (NIPBL), SMC1A, and SMC3 have been found in 60% of probands with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a dominant multi-system genetic disorder with variable expression. We have performed a genome-wide transcription assessment as well as cohesin binding analysis using human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from probands with CdLS and controls. Here, we report a unique profile of genes dysregulated in CdLS that correlates with different clinical presentations. Genome-wide analysis of cohesin binding demonstrates a preference for intergenic regions suggesting a cis-regulatory function mimicking that of an insulator. However, the binding sites are enriched within the promoter regions of the dysregulated genes and are significantly decreased in CdLS probands, indicating an alternative role of cohesin as a classic transcription factor. Cohesin also co-localizes with CTCF at the boundary elements affecting neighboring gene expression in CdLS probands. We propose that the CdLS phenotype is the result of dysregulated gene expression rather than defective sister chromatid cohesion. Phenotype specific expression profiles are also described. Experiment Overall Design: To identify differentially expressed genes between CdLS patients and controls, age and gender matched samples from 16 normal Caucasian controls and 17 clinical severely affected Caucasian patients with NIPBL protein truncating mutations (nonsense or frameshift) were chosen as the training set for the discriminate analysis. To validate the expression pattern obtained from the training set, 6 samples including 1 healthy control, 1 Egyptian CdLS patient, 2 Roberts syndrome patients, and 2 Alagille patients were used as the testing set. All the 39 cell lines were growing anonymously and the processing of these 39 cell lines were randomized by genotypes to eliminate batch effects that may contribute to genotype-specific gene expression

Description
	
The vertebrate retina uses diverse neuronal cell types arrayed into complex neural circuits to extract, process and relay information from the visual scene to the higher order processing centers of the brain. Amacrine cells, a diverse class of inhibitory interneurons, are thought to mediate the majority of the processing of the visual signal that occurs within the retina. Despite morphological characterization, the number of known molecular markers of amacrine cell types is still much smaller than the 26 morphological types that have been identified. Furthermore, it is not known how this diversity arises during development. Here, we have combined in vivo genetic labeling and single cell genome-wide expression profiling to: 1) Identify specific molecular types of amacrine cells; 2) Demonstrate the molecular diversity of the amacrine cell class. Experiment Overall Design: It is difficult to identify new markers of amacrine cells, due to the fact that they only comprise a small percentage of the total cells in the retina. Additionally, given that there are at least 26 distinct types of amacrine cells, population based approaches fail to achieve the precision necessary to discover markers of each type. To facilitate the identification of new markers for different amacrine cell classes and to more fully characterize the molecular signatures of these classes, we isolated single amacrine cells. To accomplish this goal, we introduced genetic reporters (pNdrg4::GFP or pSynapsin::GFP) into the developing retina (P0) by either in vivo or ex vivo electroporation. These reporters were observed to label morphologically distinct sets of amacrine cells at the different timepoints harvested in this study. Electroporated retinas were then dissociated at different time points and single retinal amacrine cells were isolated by virtue of their GFP expression and placed in tubes containing lysis buffer. Then, their mRNAs were reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were PCR amplified for 35 cycles. Labeled cDNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarrays and the data was normalized using MAS5.0 software.

Description
	
Mice lacking the growth associated protein, GAP-43, (KO) show multiple deficits in forebrain axon guidance and cortical cell differentiation (Donovan and McCasland, 2005). As a result, GAP-43 KO mice fail to form barrels in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1) (Maier et al., 1999). GAP-43 heterozygous (HZ) mice show abnormalities in axonal pathfinding and show larger than normal barrels in layer IV S1 due to widely branched thalamocortical afferents (TCAs). Regardless of abnormalities during early development, HZ barrels become indistinguishable from WT by postnatal day 26. One explanation for these findings is that compensatory mechanisms may be activated in GAP-43 HZ cortex. We have used mRNA microarray expression analysis to gain a more comprehensive view of genes involved in GAP-43 signaling during barrel map formation. Using laser microdissection , cortical cells of the barrel cortex were excised, RNA extracted and used in GeneChip analysis. Expression profiling and functional gene group analysis of RNA from WT, HZ, and KO cortex at postnatal day 5 was performed. We identified thousands of transcripts differentially expressed across the genotypes. Verification of selected changes in gene expression was accomplished using in situ hybridization. Our results suggest an adaptive modification in transcript expression of genes involved in cell-cell communication and synaptogenesis. These modifications appear important in forward and reverse signaling as well as maintaining synchrony between the cells. Compensatory up- and down regulation of synapse-associated genes may explain the reverse in HZ phenotype from P7 to P26. Moreover, these findings provide new insight into the role GAP-43 plays in several pathways associated with synaptogenesis and trans-synaptic signaling. Experiment Overall Design: 3 replicate RNA samples were prepared from laser microdissected barrel cortex samples of WT, HZ and KO mice at a single timepoint (postnatal day 5)

Description
	
NMNAT1 is a nuclear enzyme in the mammalian NAD+ salvage pathway. Expression microarray analysis was used to study the effect of NMNAT1 knockdown on gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Experiment Overall Design: NMNAT1 stable knockdown was achieved using a retroviral shRNA construct. An shRNA directed against Luciferase was used to generate the Luc control cells. Three independent cell populations with matching Luc controls were prepared for the expression analysis. Each cell population was treated with either vehicle control (ethanol) or estradiol (E2) for 3 hours before harvest of RNA samples. Four samples in one replicate (LUC2 CON, LUC2 E2, NMNAT2 CON and NMNAT2 E2) were hybridized to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, while the other two replicates of eight samples were hybridized to Affymetrix U133A 2.0 arrays. Experiment Overall Design: All 12 samples were included for the following data normalization steps: common probe sets on both U133A 2.0 and U133 Plus 2.0 platforms were selected; within each sample group hybridized to the same microarray platform, the signal values were log2 transformed, median centered for each array, and median centered for each gene; the data sets were further adjusted using the parametric empirical Bayes method (Combat R) to eliminate batch effect caused by the different array platforms.

Description
	
SIRT1 is a nuclear NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase. Expression microarray analysis was used to study the effect of SIRT1 knockdown on gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Experiment Overall Design: SIRT1 stable knockdown was achieved using two retroviral shRNA constructs. An shRNA directed against Luciferase was used to generate the Luc control cells. Three independent biological replicates with matching Luc controls were analyzed using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 microarrays. Experiment Overall Design: These 6 samples were part of a 15-sample microarray analysis (GSE12971) examining expression regulation by SIRT1, PARP-1, PARG and macroH2A. All 15 samples were included for the following data normalization steps: data sets obtained using the GCOS software were grouped based on date of experiment and adjusted for batch effect using the parametric empirical Bayes method (Combat R); all values < 0.01 were adjusted to 0.01; the data were log2 transformed, median centered for each array, and median centered for each gene.

Description
	
Advances in alfalfa [Medicago sativa (L.) subsp. sativa] breeding, molecular genetics and genomics have been slow because this crop is an allogamous autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 32) with complex polysomic inheritance. Increasing cellulose and decreasing lignin in alfalfa stem cell walls would improve this crop as a cellulosic ethanol feedstock. We selected two alfalfa genotypes (252, 1283) that differ in cellulose and Klason lignin concentration in stem cell walls. Analysis of GeneChip expression data files of alfalfa stem internodes of genotypes 252 and 1283 at two growth stages (elongating, post-elongation) revealed 10,887 SFPs in 8,230 probe sets. Validation analysis by PCR-sequencing of a random sample of SFPs indicated a 12% false discovery rate. Functional classification and over-representation analysis showed that both genotypes were highly enriched in SFP-harboring cell wall genes. We mapped 5,833 of the 8,230 SFP-harboring genes onto putative orthologous loci on Medicago truncatula chromosomes. Clustering and over-representation of SFP-harboring genes within the same functional class (e.g. cell wall genes) was observed on some chromosomes. Prior to analysis of expression data for the two alfalfa genotypes, SFP probes were masked to reduce false positives and false negatives. The combination of SFP and gene expression analysis provide a list of candidate cell wall genes that can be used as molecular markers in a breeding program to improve alfalfa as a cellulosic feedstock. The results of this study will also be useful in advancing understanding of genome organization in alfalfa and for comparative genomics research with other legume species.

BioEnergy Research 2: 59-76 Experiment Overall Design: The alfalfa clonal lines 252 and 1283 were propagated from cuttings and grown in the greenhouse. The greenhouse experiments consisted of three replicates arranged in a randomized complete block design. There were eight plants of each clone, in individual pots, in each replicate. Plant material for analysis was composited within each replicate at harvest. Stem internode tissues were harvested at full bloom. Based on tissue pliability and coloration, the internode in transition from elongation to post-elongation cambial growth was identified. The internodes immediately above (elongating internodes) and below this transition internode (post-elongation internodes) were collected for RNA extraction.

Description
	
We have established that BMP6 is an important endogenous regulator of human osteoblast differentiation. Our preliminary experiment showed that 8 hour BMP6 treatment induced early osteoblast markers in hMSC. In this study, we used microarrays to profile the global gene expression program in hMSC induced by BMP6 treatment and further identify the early osteogenic responses to BMP6 stimulation. Experiment Overall Design: The dataset contains a total of 4 gene chip measurements from duplicate experiments each with paired measurements of human MSC with or without 8 hours BMP6 treatment.

Description
	
We have investigated the regulation of anchorage-independent growth (AIG) by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in JB6 mouse epidermal cells in the context of wound repair versus carcinogenesis responses. bFGF induces an unusually efficient but reversible AIG response, relative to TPA-induced AIG which is irreversible. Distinct global gene expression profiles are associated with anchorage-independent colonies arising from bFGF-stimulated JB6 cells, relative to colonies arising from fully tumorigenic JB6 cells (RT101), including genes exhibiting reciprocal regulation patterns. Thus, while TPA exposure results in commitment to an irreversible and tumorigenic AIG phenotype, the AIG response to bFGF is reversible with essentially complete restoration of normal cell cycle check point control following removal of bFGF from growth medium. These results are consistent with the physiological role of bFGF in promoting wound healing, and suggest that natural mechanisms exist to reverse transformative cellular phenotypes associated with carcinogenesis. Experiment Overall Design: To determine whether there were shared transcriptional effects between reversible and irreversible AIG, we performed global microarray analyses on colonies isolated from soft agar for both bFGF-treated JB6 cells and fully tumorigenic JB6 cells from the RT101 cell line. Gene expression changes associated with colony formation were determined by comparison to respective monolayer control cells.

Description
	
Objective: Ovarian tumors of low-malignant potential (LMP) and low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas are thought to represent different stages on a tumorigenic continuum and to develop along pathways distinct from that of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Past studies have utilized gene expression profiles to support this theory. The objective of the current study was to identify new genes whose expression profiles in LMP ovarian tumors and low-grade ovarian carcinomas differ from that in high-grade ovarian carcinomas. Methods: We used RNA from 3 normal human ovarian surface epithelia (HOSE) and from 10 low-grade and 10 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples to perform gene expression profiling. Using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we evaluated changes in PAX2 mRNA expression in cDNA created from RNA extracted from an independent set of ovarian tissue samples (7 LMP tumors and 17 low-grade and 23 high-grade serous carcinomas). We also examined PAX2 expression using Western blot analysis of protein extracted from a set of ovarian LMP and low- and high-grade carcinoma tissue samples. Additionally, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to validate PAX2 overexpression in a third independent set of paraffin ovarian tissue sections from 17 LMP tumors and 16 low- and 257 high-grade carcinomas. Results: Gene profiling revealed higher expression of PAX2 in low-grade than in high-grade ovarian carcinomas. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated a statistically significant difference in median PAX2 mRNA expression, expressed as fold change, among ovarian LMP tumor (1837.38), low-grade (183.12), and high-grade (3.72) carcinoma samples (p=0.015). Western blot analysis revealed strong PAX2 expression in ovarian LMP and low-grade carcinoma samples but no PAX2 protein expression in high-grade carcinomas. On IHC, more LMP tumor and low-grade carcinoma samples expressed moderate to high levels of PAX2 than did high-grade ovarian carcinoma samples. The numbers of samples with strong nuclear staining was significantly higher for ovarian LMP tumors (10 of 17, p<0.001) and low-grade serous carcinomas (10 of 16, p<0.001) than for high-grade carcinomas (27 of 257). Discussion: Our identification and validation of higher PAX2 expression in ovarian LMP tumors and low-grade serous carcinomas than in high-grade carcinomas supports the two-tiered hypothesis that the first two are on a continuum and are distinct from high-grade ovarian carcinomas. PAX2 may represent a potential biomarker and future therapeutic target for individualizing chemotherapy for ovarian LMP tumors and low-grade carcinomas in the future. Experiment Overall Design: We used RNA from 3 normal human ovarian surface epithelia (HOSE) and from 10 low-grade and 10 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples to perform gene expression profiling. Using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we evaluated changes in PAX2 mRNA expression in cDNA created from RNA extracted from an independent set of ovarian tissue samples (7 LMP tumors and 17 low-grade and 23 high-grade serous carcinomas). We also examined PAX2 expression using Western blot analysis of protein extracted from a set of ovarian LMP and low- and high-grade carcinoma tissue samples. Additionally, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to validate PAX2 overexpression in a third independent set of paraffin ovarian tissue sections from 17 LMP tumors and 16 low- and 257 high-grade carcinomas.

Description
	
The androgen receptor (AR) directs diverse biological processes through interaction with coregulators such as androgen receptor trapped clone-27 (ART-27). The impact of ART-27 on genome-wide transcription was examined. The studies indicate that loss of ART-27 enhances expression of many androgen-regulated genes, suggesting that ART-27 inhibits gene expression. Surprisingly, classes of genes that are upregulated upon ART-27 depletion include regulators of DNA damage checkpoint and cell cycle progression, suggesting that ART-27 functions to keep expression levels of these genes low. Experiment Overall Design: Steroid-deprived LNCaP cells were transfected with control or ART-27 siRNA and stimulated with ethanol vehicle or 10 nM R1881 for 18 hrs. 8 samples, 4 conditions, 2 replicates per condition.

Description
	
Skin is usually exposed during human exposures to ionizing radiation, however there are few experiments that evaluate the radiation responsiveness of the cells of the epidermis (keratinocytes) and those of the dermis (fibroblasts) in the same studies. We evaluated the transcriptional responses of quiesent primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts from the same individual and compared them with quiescent keratinocytes and fibroblasts that were immortalized by human telomerase (hTert). The primary transcriptional responses to 10-500 cGy ionizing radiation were p53-mediated responses; however, we did identify distinct responses between the keratinocytes and the fibroblasts. Experiment Overall Design: Four cell types (primary keratinocytes, hTert immortalized keratinocytes, primary fibroblasts, hTert immortalized fibroblasts) grown to quiescence, treated with 0, 10, 100 or 500 cGy gamma irradiation, RNA collected at 4 hrs.

This study examines the sites of HIV integration in quiescent CD4 T cells and compares them to activated T cells. The expression patterns of the sites hosting integration events were determined using microarray analysis data from quiescent and activated CD4 T cells. Experiment Overall Design: Integration sites were isolated by inverse PCR analysis. Quiescent and stimulated T cells from different donors were assayed in 10 g of leukocyte total RNA using a high-density oligonucleotide array (U133a; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif) at baseline and after PSD for genome-wide mRNA expression profiles. All assays were performed by the UCLA DNA Microarray Core (Affymetrix) following the manufacturer's standard protocol, with sample quality assured for RNA concentration and purity using a bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, Calif) prior to probe synthesis. Following hybridization of fluorescent complementary RNA probes, microarrays were imaged using a scanner (Affymetrix), and low-level gene expression values were derived using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) (Affymetrix) and analyzed using dChip software (Harvard School of Public Health). The data submitted here have been normalized using RMAExpress.

Description
	
Gene expression was measured on the Affymetrix platform in primary xenografts, xenograft-derived cell lines, secondary xenografts, normal lung, and primary tumors obtained from chemotherapy naive Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). The SCLC primary xenografts were serially propagated in vivo in immunodeficient mice. Cell lines were derived from each xenograft and grown for 6 months using conventional tissue culture conditions. Secondary xenografts were obtained from cell cultures by re-implantation in immunodeficient mice. Such SCLC laboratory models were analyzed along with conventional SCLC cell lines and the derivative secondary xenografts, with normal lung and primary tumors, to assess irreversible gene expression changes induced by culturing conditions. Experiment Overall Design: SCLC primary xenografts were compared to the corresponding xenograft-derived cell lines, and to the secondary xenografts established from the cell lines using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Gene expression from SCLC primary tumors was measured using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array. 3 datasets: GSM380476-GSM380512, GSM380513-GSM380516, and GSM380517-GSM380520

Description
	
The transcriptional control of CNS myelin gene expression is poorly understood. Here we identify gene model 98, which we have named Myelin-gene Regulatory Factor (MRF), as a transcriptional regulator required for CNS myelination. Within the CNS, MRF is specifically expressed by postmitotic oligodendrocytes. MRF is a nuclear protein containing an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain homologous to a yeast transcription factor. Knockdown of MRF in oligodendrocytes by RNA interference prevents expression of most CNS myelin genes; conversely, overexpression of MRF within cultured oligodendrocyte progenitors or the chick spinal cord promotes expression of myelin genes. In mice lacking MRF within the oligodendrocyte lineage, pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes are generated but display severe deficits in myelin gene expression and fail to myelinate. These mice display severe neurological abnormalities, and die due to seizures during the third postnatal week. These findings establish MRF as a critical transcriptional regulator essential for oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination. We used microarrays to compare cultured oligodendrocytes (differentiated in vitro for 4 days) from MRF conditional knockouts and control litteramates to look at the effects of MRF deficiency on myelin gene expression. Mouse OPCs grown in vitro in the presence of PDGF serve as a baseline for gene expression prior to differentiation. Experiment Overall Design: Mouse OPCs from MRF conditional knockout (MRF fl/fl, Olig2 wt/cre) mice and control littermates (MRF wt/fl; Olig2 wt/cre) were isolated from enzymatically dissociated P7 mouse brains as previously described (Cahoy et al., 2008), positively immunopanning for PDGFR-alpha following a depletion of microglia with BSL1. Cells were grown in defined serum-free media as previously described (Dugas et al., 2006), but with the addition of 2% B-27 (Invitrogen). Cells were proliferated for several days in the presence of PDGF-AA (10 ng/ml, PeproTech) and then differentiation induced by withdrawal of PDGF-AA and addition of triiodothyronine (T3) (40 ng/ml; Sigma). RNA was isolated from cells 4 days after induction of differentiation; OPCs maintained in PDGF-AA serve as a baseline of OPC gene expression. Total RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using Qiagen on-column DNase treatment to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. The integrity of RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Rockland, DE). Biotinylated cRNAs for hybridization to Affymetrix 3'-arrays were prepared from 1ug total RNA using the Affymetrix two-cycle target labeling assay with spike in controls (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, 900494). Labeled-cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (3'-arrays, Affymetrix, 900495) following the manufacturer's protocols. Raw image files were processed using Affymetrix GCOS 1.3 software to calculate individual probe cell intensity data and generate CEL data files. Using GCOS and the MAS 5.0 algorithm, intensity data was normalized per chip to a target intensity TGT value of 500 and expression data and present/absent calls for individual probe sets calculated. Gene symbols and names for data analyzed with the MAS 5.0 algorithm were from the Affymetrix Netaffx Mouse430_2 annotations file (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430-20). Quality control was performed by examining raw DAT image files for anomalies, confirming each GeneChip array had a background value less than 100, monitoring that the percencelle present calls was appropriate for the cell type, and inspecting the poly(A) spike in controls, housekeeping genes, and hybridization controls to confirm labeling and hybridization consistency.

Description
	
For more than a decade, microarrays have been a powerful and widely used tool to explore the transcriptome of biological systems. However, the amount of biological material from cell sorting or laser capture microdissection is much too small to perform microarray studies. To address this issue, RNA amplification methods have been developed to generate sufficient targets from picogram amounts of total RNA to perform microarray hybridisation. In this study, four commercial protocols for amplification of picograms amounts of input RNA for microarray expression profiling were evaluated and compared. The quantitative and qualitative performances of the methods were assessed. Microarrays were hybridised with the amplified targets and the amplification protocols were compared with respect to the quality of expression profiles, reproducibility within a concentration range of input RNA, and sensitivity. Experiment Overall Design: Four commercial protocols for amplification of picograms amounts of input RNA for microarray expression profiling were evaluated and compared. For each protocol, one RNA amplification was performed from 250 pg, and one from 500 pg of human universal RNA by two operators in two independent laboratories and compared to the amplified aRNA obtained from 2 g and 100 ng RNA inputs following the standard protocol proposed by Affymetrix. A negative control (amplification without total RNA) and a positive control (if available) were included in each experimental batch. Experiment Overall Design: Samples indicating 50, 100, and 1000 pg RNA inputs correspond to 3 additional quantities of total RNA used to synthesise the cDNA target using the nugen protocol for comparison (250, 500 pg + 50, 100, 1000 pg).

Description
	
Hepatic lipid accumulation is an important complication of obesity linked to risk for type 2 diabetes. To identify novel transcriptional changes in human liver which could contribute to hepatic lipid accumulation and associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (DM2), we evaluated gene expression and gene set enrichment in surgical liver biopsies from 13 obese (9 with DM2) and 5 control subjects, obtained in the fasting state at the time of elective abdominal surgery for obesity or cholecystectomy. RNA was isolated for cRNA preparation and hybridized to Affymetrix U133A microarrays. Experiment Overall Design: Human liver samples were obtained from 5 lean control subjects undergoing elective cholecystectomy and 13 obese subjects (with or without Type 2 diabetes) undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Subjects with diabetes were classified as either well-controlled or poorly-controlled.

Description
	
The Dbl family of proteins represents a large group of proto-oncogenes involved in cell growth regulation. Alterations of the normal function of these proteins lead to pathological processes such as developmental disorders and neoplastic transformation. We have generated transgenic mice introducing the onco-Dbl cDNA sequences linked to the metallothionein promoter into the germ line of FVB mice and found that onco-Dbl expression affected proliferation, migration and differentiation of lens epithelial cells. We used high density oligonucleotide microarray to define the transcriptional profile induced by Dbl in the lenses of transgenic mice and observed modulation of genes encoding proteins promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, genes encoding proteins involved in the positive regulation of apoptosis were markedly down regulated while anti-apoptotic genes were strongly up-regulated. Finally, several genes encoding proteins involved in the process of angiogenesis were up-regulated. These observations were validated by histological and immunohistochemical examination of the transgenic lenses, where vascularization can be readily observed. Thus, onco-Dbl expression in mouse lenses induces disruption of the lens architecture, epithelial cell proliferation, EMT, evasion from cell death, and aberrant angiogenesis. Experiment Overall Design: Whole lenses were removed from 2, 14, and 42 day old Dbl transgenic and wild type mice. 4 to 8 individual lenses were pooled . Three independent pools from each time and condition were used as replicates.

Description
	
Functional genomic analysis of frataxin deficiency reveals tissue-specific alterations and identifies the PPAR pathway as a therapeutic target in Friedreich's ataxia; Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common inherited ataxia, is characterized by focal neurodegeneration, diabetes mellitus, and life-threatening cardiomyopathy. Frataxin, which is significantly reduced in patients with this recessive disorder, is a mitochondrial iron-binding protein, but how its deficiency leads to neurodegeneration and metabolic derangements is not known. We performed microarray analysis of heart and skeletal muscle in a mouse model of frataxin deficiency, and found molecular evidence of increased lipogenesis in skeletal muscle, and alteration of fiber-type composition in heart, consistent with insulin resistance and cardiomyopathy, respectively. Since the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR ) pathway is known to regulate both processes, we hypothesized that dysregulation of this pathway could play a key role in frataxin deficiency. We confirmed this by showing a coordinate dysregulation of the PPAR coactivator Pgc1a and transcription factor Srebp1 in cellular and animal models of frataxin deficiency, and in cells from FRDA patients, who have marked insulin resistance. Finally, we show that genetic modulation of the PPAR pathway affects frataxin levels in vitro, supporting PPAR as a novel therapeutic target in FRDA. Experiment Overall Design: To compare frataxin deficient (KIKO) mice vs. WT, heart and skeletal muscle. Three replicates (KIKO vs WT), with dye swap

Description
	
The aim of this study was to compare the gene expression profile changes of DMBA-induced rat breast tumors after treatment with hydroxytyrosol (a natural compound from virgin olive oil). To this end, a cDNA microarray experiment was performed (Affymetrix s Rat Genome 230 2.0 array). This gene expression study was carried out on the tumor biopsy samples prior to hydroxytyrosol treatment, and compared with matched tumor biopsy samples after completion of the hydroxytyrosol treatment schedule. The result of this study was the identification of several genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, proliferation, differentiation, survival and transformation-related genes. Experiment Overall Design: Breast tumors were induced with a single oral dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz(alpha)anthracene (100 mg/kg body weight) in female Sprague-Dawley rats to test the antitumor power of orally administrated hydroxytyrosol (0.5 mg/kg body weight 5 days/week for 6 weeks). Gene expression analysis was performed in paired samples as follows: HT final trucut tumor vs initial trucut tumor (HT final vs basal). For this assay, 5 samples were chosen according to histopathologic criteria (Bloom-Richardson grade II). Gene expression profiling was carried out using Affymetrix s GeneChip technology, using the Rat Genome 230 v2.0 array from this provider. All the protocols and apparatus were recommended by Affymetrix. Total RNA from frozen mammary tumors was extracted by RNeasy Mini kit and homogenized by QIAshredder columns according to manufacturer s instructions. The quality and quantity of the obtained RNA was checked out through agarose electrophoresis and later spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm. Biotinylated cRNA was synthesized following the IVT labeling kit from Affymetrix and purified by the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module from Affymetrix. The quality and quantity of the obtained cRNA was again checked out through agarose electrophoresis and posterior spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm. After hybridization, slides were washed and scanned following the manufacturer s standard protocol. Intensity values were normalized by Robust Multichip Average method and subsequently these were filtered to remove the control sequences and those with a hybridization signal close to background. The spike controls were: BioB, BioC, BioD and Cre; because BioB was the least abundant in the samples, it was used to estimate the sensitivity of the experiment. The housekeeping control was GAPDH. After non-supervised clustering using Pearson correlation coefficient, statistical significance of gene expression was estimated by Student s T test for paired samples using GeneSpring GX 7.3 software (Agilent).

Description
	
AML with mutated NPM1 usually carries normal karyotype (NK) but it may harbor chromosomal aberrations whose significance remains unclear. We addressed this question in 631 AML patients with mutated/cytoplasmic NPM1. An abnormal karyotype (AK) was present in 93/631 cases (14.7%), the most frequent abnormalities being +8, +4, -Y, del(9q), +21. Chromosome aberrations in NPM1-mutated AML were similar to, but occurred less frequently than additional chromosome changes found in other AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities according to WHO classification. Four of the 31 NPM1-mutated AML patients karyotyped at different time points had NK at diagnosis but AK at relapse: del(9q) (n=2), t(2;11) (n=1), inv(12) (n=1). NPM1-mutated AML with NK or AK showed overlapping morphological, immunophenotypic (CD34-negativity) and gene expression profile (downregulation of CD34 and upregulation of HOX genes). No difference in survival was observed among NPM1-mutated AML patients independently of whether they carried a normal or abnormal karyotype, the NPM1-mutated/FLT3-ITD negative cases showing the better prognosis. Findings in our patients point to chromosomal aberrations as secondary events, reinforce the concept that NPM1 mutation is a founder genetic lesion and indicate that NPM1-mutated AML should be clinically handled as one entity, irrespective of the karyotype. Experiment Overall Design: All bone marrow samples were obtained from untreated patients at the time of diagnosis. Cells used for microarray analysis were collected from the purified fraction of mononuclear cells after Ficoll density centrifugation.

Description
	
To date, all methods to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells require the use of genetic materials and/or potentially mutagenic chemicals. Here we report the generation of stable human iPS cells from human fibroblasts by directly delivering defined reprogramming proteins. This system eliminates the potential risks associated with genetic and/or chemical manipulation, and could provide a safe and physiologically intact source of cells for regenerative medicine. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNAs were prepared from human fibroblasts, H9, and hiPS lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Expression Array U133 Plus 2.0 analyzing over 47,000 human transcripts at the Harvard Partners Center for Genomics and Genetics. Detailed procedure is described in the website at http://www.hpcgg.org/Microarrays/overview.jsp

Description
	
Anoxia induces several heat shock proteins and a heat pre-treatment can acclimatize Arabidopsis seedlings to a subsequent anoxic treatment. In this work we analyzed the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to anoxia, heat and a combined heat+anoxia stress. A significant overlapping between the anoxic and heat shock responses has been observed by whole-genome microarray analysis. Experiment Overall Design: We treated Arabidopsis seedling, 4-days old, dark germinated with: Experiment Overall Design: -Control (23 C, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -Heat-treated (38 C for 90 minutes, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -Anoxia-treated (23 C, under anoxia for 6h, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -combined heat+Anoxia-treatment (23 C, treated at 38 C for 90 min and thereafter under anoxia for 6h, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: Two biological replicates for each condition.

Description
	
The aim of this study was to compare the gene expression profile changes of DMBA-induced rat breast tumors after treatment with adriamycin. To this end, a cDNA microarray was performed (Affymetrix s Rat Genome 230 2.0 array). This gene expression study was carried out on the tumor biopsy samples prior to adriamycin treatment, and compared with matched tumor biopsy samples after completion of the adriamycin treatment schedule. Experiment Overall Design: Breast tumors were induced with a single oral dosage of 7,12-dimethylbenz(alpha)anthracene (100 mg/kg body weight) in female Sprague-Dawley rats and subsequently treated with adriamycin (1 mg/kg body weight/week for 6 weeks) intravenously through lateral tail vein. Gene expression analysis was performed in paired samples as follows: ADR final trucut tumor vs initial trucut tumor (ADR final vs basal). For this assay, 5 samples were chosen according to histopathologic criteria (Bloom-Richardson grade II). Gene expression profiling was carried out using Affymetrix s GeneChip technology, using the Rat Genome 230 2.0 array from this provider. All the protocols and apparatus were recommended by Affymetrix. Total RNA from frozen mammary tumors was extracted by RNeasy Mini kit and homogenized by QIAshredder columns according to manufacturer s instructions. The quality and quantity of the obtained RNA was checked out through agarose electrophoresis and later spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm. Biotinylated cRNA was synthesized following the IVT labeling kit from Affymetrix and purified by the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module from Affymetrix. The quality and quantity of the obtained cRNA was again checked out through agarose electrophoresis and posterior spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm. After hybridization, slides were washed and scanned following the manufacturer s standard protocol. Intensity values were normalized by Robust Multichip Average method and subsequently these were filtered to remove the control sequences and those with a hybridization signal close to background. The spike controls were: BioB, BioC, BioD and Cre; because BioB was the least abundant in the samples, it was used to estimate the sensitivity of the experiment. The housekeeping control was GAPDH. After non-supervised clustering using Pearson correlation coefficient, statistical significance of gene expression was estimated by Student s T test for paired samples, using GeneSpring GX 7.3 software (Agilent).

The aim of this study was to compare the gene expression profile changes of DMBA-induced rat breast tumors from an initial stage to the moment of sacrifice. To this end, a cDNA microarray was performed (Affymetrix s Rat Genome 230 2.0 array). This gene expression study was carried out on the umor biopsy samples and compared with matched tumor biopsy samples once the study ended (7 weeks after initial biopsy).

Description
	
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDSs) are a heterogeneous family of clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and frequently leukemia progression. To exlore how MDS develop into leukemia, we performed the transcriptional profiling of lesional cells and normal lymphoid cells from the MDS patients. Experiment Overall Design: Bone marrow cells from the MDS patients were sorted into blastic, myeloid, erythroid and lymphoid fractions by flow cytometry and then were profiled transcriptionally by Human Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Differentially expressed genes between lesional cells and lymphoid cells were identified by SAM.

Description
	
We used DNA microarrays to compare RNA transcript expression from distinct cell populations sorted by FACS with an antibody against the 67Kd laminin receptor (67LR), and showing distinct tumorigenicity in vivo. Experiment Overall Design: Sorted cells were derived by digesting xenografted sw 780 tumors into single cell suspensions. Differential gene expression was assessed by direct comparisons of labeled moieties, using a dye-swap design and biological replication. Hybridizations were performed on Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) Whole Human Genome DNA microarrays (hgug4112a). Three different samples were analyzed: 1) Urothelial cancer cells expressing 67LR (67LR+, BRIGHT); 2) Urothelial cancer cells not expressing 67LR (67LR-, DIM); 3) Control sorted urothelial cancer cells (BULK, containing both BRIGHT and DIM cells). In this series we provide normalized single channel intensities, aligned with the corresponding raw expression data.

Description
	
PPARg and C/EBPa cooperate to control preadipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis). However, the factors that regulate PPARg and C/EBPa expression during adipogenesis remain largely unclear. Here we show PTIP, a protein that associates with histone H3K4 methyltransferases, regulates PPARg and C/EBPa expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and during preadipocyte differentiation. PTIP deletion in MEFs leads to marked decreases of PPARg expression and PPARg-stimulated C/EBP expression. Further, PTIP is essential for induction of PPARg and C/EBPa expression during preadipocyte differentiation. Deletion of PTIP impairs the enrichment of H3K4 trimethylation and RNA polymerase II on PPARg and C/EBPa promoters. Accordingly, PTIP-/- MEFs and preadipocytes all show striking defects in adipogenesis. Furthermore, rescue of the adipogenesis defect in PTIP-/- MEFs requires co-expression of PPARg and C/EBPa. Finally, deletion of PTIP in brown adipose tissue significantly reduces tissue weight in mice. Thus, by regulating PPARg and C/EBPa expression, PTIP plays a critical role in adipogenesis. Experiment Overall Design: To identify PTIP-regulated genes, immortalized PTIP conditional knockout PTIPflox/flox MEFs were infected with retroviruses expressing either Cre recombinase or vector alone. We prepared duplicated RNAs from either vector or Cre infected cells (PTIP+/+ or PTIP-/-) for 4 affymetrix microarrays.

Description
	
Retinoic acid (RA) is an important developmental signaling molecule responsible for the patterning of multiple vertebrate tissues. RA is also a potent teratogen, causing multi-organ birth defects in humans. Endogenous RA levels must therefore be tightly controlled in the developing embryo. In order to understand the RA function and regulation at the genomic level, we used a microarray approach to identify genes that function as negative feedback regulators of retinoic acid signaling. To that end, we treated embryos with different chemicals: DMSO as control, AGN193019 as RA antagonist at high concentration 10uM and low concentration 1uM, as well as 0.33uM RA. Each treatment has four biological replicates. We screened for genes expressed in early somite-stage embryos that respond oppositely to treatment with RA versus RA antagonists, and validated them by whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. Experiment Overall Design: Each treatment was performed four times, for a total of 16 independent samples (4 x 0.33 M RA, 4 x 10 M AGN193109, 4 x 1 M AGN193109 and 4 x DMSO control).

Description
	
Untreated HIV-1 infection progresses through acute and asymptomatic stages to AIDS. While each of the three stages has well-known clinical, virologic and immunological characteristics, much less is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying each stage. Here we report lymphatic tissue microarray analyses revealing for the first time stage-specific patterns of gene expression during HIV-1 infection. We show that while there is a common set of key genes with altered expression throughout all stages, each stage has a unique gene-expression signature. The acute stage is most notably characterized by increased expression of hundreds of genes involved in immune activation, innate immune defenses (e.g.MDA-5, TLR-7 and -8, PKR, APOBEC3B, 3F, 3G), adaptive immunity, and in the pro-apoptotic Fas-Fas-L pathway. Yet, quite strikingly, the expression of nearly all acute-stage genes return to baseline levels in the asymptomatic stage, accompanying partial control of infection. In the AIDS stage, decreased expression of numerous genes involved in T cell signaling identifies genes contributing to T cell dysfunction. These common and stage-specific, gene-expression signatures provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response and the slow, natural course of HIV-1 infection. Experiment Overall Design: A total of 52 patients were analyzed: 10 patients unaffected, 18 patients with asymptomatic stages of AIDs, 16 patients with acute stages of AIDs, and 8 patients with AIDs.

Description
	
The aim of this study was to determine the transcriptomic response of Saccharomyces pastorianus to environmental change during brewery propagation. Utilization of amino acids and fermentable carbohydrates during full-scale brewery propagation was compared to the simultaneous changes occurring in the yeast transcriptome. Transcription profiles were observed to fall within one of four different groups and the greatest changes were observed to occur within the first eight hours following inoculation. Nutrient uptake was at its greatest during this period and many genes involved in the utilization of amino acids and carbohydrates were activated. There was also a significant derepression response following monosaccharide exhaustion. A number of stress response genes were activated following inoculation, indicating a possible osmotic stress response. Nutrient limitation did not appear to initiate a significant stress response, but did activate genes involved in pseudohyphal growth and meiosis, despite the fact that neither biological process occurs in the strain utilized. The first hours after inoculation into propagation wort are particularly active with respect to nutrient utilization and transcriptional change. It is likely that this period is particularly stressful for the yeast cells though there is no evidence of viability loss and it may be concluded that the yeast cell can cope with this level of stress, possibly aided by the dynamic response of the transcriptome. Experiment Overall Design: GeneChip analyses were performed to determine the transcriptomic response of Saccharomyces pastorianus to environmental change during brewery propagation. Triplicate samples were taken immediately after inoculation and at intervals 4h, 8h, and 30h.

Description
	
One day-old broilers (Ross/Ross, Longenecker's Hatchery, Elizabethtown, PA) were housed in Petersime starter brooder units and randomly assigned to 4 groups (5 birds/group). Carvacrol (Nature Chemicals, Hamburg, Germany) and cinnamaldehyde (Alys Technologies SA, Bussigny-pr s-Lausanne, Switzerland) were obtained from the compound obtained from synthesis. Crushed C. annuum fruits (Pushp Brand Spices, Munimji Foods and Spices Pvt. Ltd. Indore, India) were extracted with volatile solvents using the percolation method to obtain oleoresin. Chickens were fed for 7 days beginning from hatch with a standard diet alone (control) or with diets supplemented with carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, or Capsicum oleoresin.
Following euthanization of the birds, intestines were cut longitudinally and washed three times with ice-cold Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The mucosal layer of entire intestine was carefully scraped using a surgical scalpel and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were isolated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as previously described (Min et al. 2005). Total RNA was isolated from 5.0 x 107 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using the RNeasy Mini RNA Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Aminoallyl-labeled RNA from IELs was prepared using the Amino Allyl Message Amp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Two of 20 ?g aliquots of each aminoallyl-RNA sample were fluorescently labeled with AlexaFluor 555 or AlexaFluor 647 (Invitrogen) and labeled RNAs were column-purified using the RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). RNA concentrations and labeling efficiencies were determined spectrophotometrically.
Hybridizations were performed using HybIt hybridization buffer (TeleChem, Sunnyvale, CA) in ArrayIt reaction cassettes at 50 C overnight as described (Kim et al., 2008). After hybridization, the slides were rinsed in 0.5 X SSC, 0.01% SDS at room temperature and washed once for 15 min in 0.2 X SSC, 0.2% SDS at 50 C, 3 times for 1 min in 0.2 X SSC at room temperature, and 3 times for 1 min in distilled water at room temperature. Each sample had a repeated hybridization using the alternate fluorescent dye between the treatment and control.

Description
	
The ability of dendritic cells (DC) to initiate immunity and induce antigen-specific tolerance makes DC ideal targets for pharmacological intervention into immune responses. NF-kB factors are a family of transcriptional regulators important for DC development and function. However, the identity of NF-kB target genes that are central to DC biology is largely unknown. In the present study IkBa super repressor (IkBa-SR) and DNA microarray analysis were used to determine the repertoire of NF-kB responsive genes in DC. In DC these genes regulate vital DC functions of antigen uptake and presentation, motility, survival, etc. Taking in account limitations of the genome-wide microarray analysis, generated transcription factor data were confirmed by the independent means of RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Kinetics of NF-kB induction by well-known DC activatory agents TNFa and LPS were further analysed. NF-kB regulated genes can be potentially useful targets for the development of more specific anti-inflammatory agents for clinical applications. Experiment Overall Design: DC were generated in vitro from bone marrow of CAR transgenic mice as described previously (Hieronymus, T., T. C. Gust, R. D. Kirsch, T. Jorgas, G. Blendinger, M. Goncharenko, K. Supplitt, S. Rose-John, A. M. Muller, and M. Zenke. 2005. Progressive and controlled development of mouse dendritic cells from Flt3+CD11b+ progenitors in vitro. J Immunol 174:2552-2562). Immature DC were transduced with AdIkBa-SR adenovirus, AdOVA control virus, or left untreated. Cells were then stimulated with TNFa, or left unstimulated. Total RNA was amplified, labelled and hybridised to Affymetrix MOE430A arrays. TNFa up- and down-regulated genes, as well as genes regulated by AdOVA control virus, and suppressed by AdIkBa-SR were analysed.

Description
	
The ability of dendritic cells (DC) to initiate immunity and induce antigen-specific tolerance makes DC ideal targets for pharmacological intervention into immune responses. NF-kB factors are a family of transcriptional regulators important for DC development and function. However, the identity of NF-kB target genes that are central to DC biology is largely unknown. In the present study inhibition of the NF-kB activation by the IkBa super repressor (IkBa-SR) and DNA microarray analysis were used to determine the repertoire of NF-kB responsive genes in DC. A number of immunomodulatory compounds have been suggested to target the NF-kB signalling pathway and/or NF-kB-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory target genes. 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) exerts its effects through the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Microarray analysis was also selected as an approach of choice for the analysis of the effects of VD3 on the activation of DC, and to survey the involvement of VDR in repression of NF-kB regulated genes. These genes can be potentially useful targets for the development of more specific anti-inflammatory agents for clinical applications. Experiment Overall Design: DC were generated in vitro from bone marrow cells of VDRmut and VDRwt control mice as described previously (Hieronymus, T., T. C. Gust, R. D. Kirsch, T. Jorgas, G. Blendinger, M. Goncharenko, K. Supplitt, S. Rose-John, A. M. Muller, and M. Zenke. 2005. Progressive and controlled development of mouse dendritic cells from Flt3+CD11b+ progenitors in vitro. J Immunol 174:2552-2562). Immature DC were pre-treated with 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), or left untreated. TNFa was added where appropriate, and cells incubated further for 4 h. Total RNA was amplified, labelled and hybridised to Affymetrix MOE430A arrays. TNFa up- and down-regulated genes, as well as genes affected by VD3 were analysed.

Description
	
Background. Vaginal atrophy (VA) is the thinning of the vaginal epithelial lining, typically the result of lowered estrogen levels during menopause. Some of the consequences of VA include increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, pain during sexual intercourse, and vaginal burning or itching. Although estrogen treatment is highly effective, alternative therapies are also desired for women who are not candidates for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The ovariectomized (OVX) rat is widely accepted as an appropriate animal model for many estrogen-dependent responses in humans; however, since reproductive biology can vary significantly between mammalian systems, this study examined how well the OVX rat recapitulates human biology at the transcriptional level. This report describes an analysis of expression profiling data, comparing the responses of rat and human vaginae to estrogen treatment. Results. The level of differential expression between pre- vs. post- estrogen treatment was calculated for each of the human and OVX rat datasets. Probe sets corresponding to orthologous rat and human genes were mapped to each other using NCBI Homologene. A positive correlation was observed between the rat and human responses to estrogen. Genes belonging to several biological pathways and GO categories were similarly differentially expressed in rat and human. A large number of the coordinately regulated biological processes are already known to be involved in human VA, such as inflammation, epithelial development, and EGF pathway activation. Conclusions. At the transcriptional level, there is evidence of significant overlap of the effects of estrogen treatment between the OVX rat and human VA samples. Experiment Overall Design: We analyzed vaginal biopsies from 19 woman pre and post 3 month estradiol treatment and compared to OVX rats treated with E2 for 6 hr, 3 days or 5 days (N=5)

Description
	
The Tec-family kinase Itk plays an important role during T-cell activation and function, and controls also conventional versus innate-like T-cell development. We have characterized the transcriptome of Itk-deficient CD3+ T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, using Affymetrix microarrays. The largest difference between Itk-/- and Wt CD3+ T-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. Compared to anti-CD3-stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of Itk. The signatures of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total CD3+ cells. Cyclosporin (CsA)-treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than Itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of TCR-mediated calcineurin/NFAT-activation is dependent on Itk. Bioinformatic analysis of NFAT-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by Itk-deficiency and CsA-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed NFATc1-binding to the Bub1, IL7R, Ctla2a, Ctla2b, and Schlafen1 genes. Finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by Tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of Itk-deficient T-cells with that of Btk-deficient B-cells and a common set of transcripts was found. Taken together, our study provides a general overview about the global transcriptional changes in the absence of Itk. Experiment Overall Design: CD3+ T-cells from pooled suspensions of spleen and lymph nodes of Wt and Itk knockout mice on C57BL/6 background were isolated after negative depletion. Unstimulated as well as stimulated T-cells were studied. Stimulations were done with anti-CD3 (1 mg/ml) with or without anti-CD28 (3 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of CsA (1 mg/ml) for 24 hrs. For each stimulus, at least duplicate samples were used.

For the CD4+ T-cells we collected triplicates from the Itk knockout mice and duplicates from the Wt group. For the CD8+ T-cells, we got duplicates from Itk knockout , while we obtained a single sample from Wt owing to the low cell yield for resting Wt CD8+ T-cells.

Description
	
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular defense mechanism against glucose deprivation, a cell condition that occurs in solid tumors. A key feature of the UPR is the activation of the transcription program that allows the cell to cope with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We used micoarrays to show that the UPR transcription program is disrupted by the antitumor macrocyclic compound versipelostatin (VST) and antidiabetic biguanides metformin, buformin and phenformin, depending on cellular glucose availability. Experiment Overall Design: Total 42 samples were prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Experiment Overall Design: To induce the UPR, we treated cells (HeLa, HT-29, HT1080, MKN74) for 15 or 18 hours under ER stress conditions by replacing the medium with glucose-free medium or by adding either 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) or Tunicamycin (TM) to glucose-containing medium. UPR modulators (VST, biguanides or pyrvinium pamoate) were added at various final concentrations immediately after cells were placed in glucose-free medium or just before the chemical stressors were added to glucose-containing culture medium.

Description
	
During embryogenesis, the pancreas develops from separate dorsal and ventral buds, which fuse to form the mature pancreas. Little is known about the functional differences between these two buds or the relative contribution of cells derived from each portion to the pancreas after fusion. To follow the fate of dorsal or ventral bud derived cells in the pancreas after fusion, we produced chimeric Elas-GFP transgenic/wild type embryos in which either dorsal or ventral pancreatic bud cells expressed GFP. We found that ventral pancreatic cells migrate extensively into the dorsal pancreas after fusion, whereas the converse does not occur. Moreover, we found that annular pancreatic tissue is composed exclusively of ventral pancreas derived cells. To identify ventral pancreas specific genes that may play a role in pancreatic bud fusion, we isolated individual dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds, prior to fusion, from stage 38/39 Xenopus laevis tadpoles and compared their gene expression profiles. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of one of these ventral specific genes, transmembrane 4 superfamily member 3 (tm4sf3), inhibited dorsal-ventral pancreatic bud fusion as well as acinar cell differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of tm4sf3 promoted the development of annular pancreas. Our results are the first to define molecular and behavioral differences between the dorsal and ventral pancreas, and suggest an unexpected role for the ventral pancreas in pancreatic bud fusion. Experiment Overall Design: We analyzed two samples of dorsal and two samples of ventral pancreatic buds.

Description
	
Laminar shear stress due to constant blood flow is known to play a critical role in maintaining vascular health. In contrast, endothelial cell senescence appears to be closely associated with the incidence of vascular disorder. In an attempt to identify functional biomarkers for age-related vascular health/disease, the present study investigated differential gene expression of young and senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under static and laminar shear stress. We used a cDNA microarray method to compare gene expression profiles of young and senescent HUVECs under static and laminar shear stress conditions. Experiment Overall Design: Senescent cells were prepared by continuous subculture in vitro, and a cone-and-plate device was used to impose laminar shear stress onto cells. Young and senescent cells were exposed to laminar shear stress or maintained under static conditions. Total mRNA was extracted and gene expression profiles were analyzed by cDNA microarray.

Description
	
Tomato fruit ripening is associated with a dramatic increase in susceptibility to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of gray mold. Mature green fruit, prior to ripening, are largely resistant to B. cinerea, whereas red fruit, at the end of ripening, are susceptible to B. cinerea infection. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression changes that are induced by B. cinerea when tomato fruit at unripe and ripe stages are infected. Experiment Overall Design: Tomato fruit at mature green and red ripe stages were wound inoculated with a water suspension of B. cinerea conidia. Twenty four hours post inoculation fruit pericarp and epicarp tissue around and including the inoculation sites was collected and the total RNA extracted. Total RNA was also collected from healthy and mock inoculated fruit.

Description
	
Work previously published by our group has demonstrated that T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) show differentially regulated genes compared with healthy T cells. This study was initiated to examine if these gene expression changes were unique to CLL T cells or common to an alternative leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Experiment Overall Design: The study was composed of four groups of samples: AML CD4 (n=10), AML CD8 (n=10), Healthy CD4 (n=10), Healthy CD8 (n=11). AML samples were chosen to represent the range of FAB types, prognostic groups and patient outcomes. Healthy T cells were obtained from volunteers. The purity of isolated T cell fractions was greater than 70% in all cases.

Description
	
Negative immunomagnetic selection has become the method of choice for isolating T cell subsets for functional studies due to concerns that directly binding antibody to the surface of a cell, as occurs with positive selection, results in cross-linking of surface antigens, altered gene transcription and subsequent cellular activation. However there is little data to support this. We therefore examined the impact of the method of immunomagnetic cell selection on the gene expression profile of healthy human CD4 and CD8 T cells in a total of 21 cases. Experiment Overall Design: This study was composed of 4 groups of samples: CD4 Negative Selection (n=5), CD4 Positive Selection (n=5), CD8 Negative Selection (n=5), CD8 Positive Selection (n=6). Two samples (PS6 CD8 and PS9 CD4) were removed from the analysis due to discrepant normalised unscaled standard errors

Description
	
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are key regulators of anti-viral immunity. They rapidly secrete IFN-alpha and cross-present viral antigens thereby launching adaptive immunity. Here we show that activated human pDCs inhibit replication of cancer cells, and kill them in a contact dependent fashion. Expression of CD2 distinguishes two pDC subsets with distinct phenotype and function. Both subsets secrete IFN-alpha and express Granzyme B and TRAIL. CD2high pDCs uniquely express lysozyme and can be found in tonsils and in tumors. Both subsets launch recall T cell response. However, CD2high pDCs secrete higher levels of IL12 p40, express higher levels of co-stimulatory molecule CD80 and are more efficient in triggering proliferation of na ve allogeneic T cells. Thus, human blood pDCs are composed of subsets with specific phenotype and functions. Experiment Overall Design: pDC subsets were isolated from two different donors. They were analyzed in two independent experiments.

Description
	
Gene expression profiles of subsets of CD4+ T cells according to their expression of FoxP3 and CD45RA were compared. Abstract:; FoxP3 is a key transcription factor for the development and function of natural CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here we show that human FoxP3+CD4+ T cells are composed of three phenotypically and functionally distinct subpopulations: CD45RA+FoxP3low resting Tregs (rTregs) and CD45RA-FoxP3high activated Tregs (aTregs), both of which are suppressive in vitro, and cytokine-secreting CD45RA-FoxP3low non-suppressive T cells. The proportion of the three subpopulations characteristically altered in cord blood, aged individuals, and patients with immunological diseases. Terminally differentiated aTregs rapidly die while rTregs proliferate and convert into aTregs in vitro and in vivo as shown by the transfer of rTregs into NOD-scid-common gamma-chain-knockout mice and by TCR sequence-based T cell clonotype tracing in peripheral blood of normal individuals. Taken together, the dissection of FoxP3+ cells into subsets enables one to analyze Treg differentiation dynamics and interactions in normal and disease states, and to control immune responses through manipulating particular FoxP3+ subpopulations. Experiment Overall Design: RNA was extracted from freshly obtained peripheral blood lymphocytes from a healthy donor that were separated according to their expression of CD25, CD127 and CD45RA after surface staining.

Description
	
Skin and bladder epithelia form effective permeability barriers through the activation of distinct differentiation gene programs. Employing a genome-wide gene expression study, we identified transcription regulators whose expression correlates highly with that of differentiation markers both in bladder and skin, including the Grainyhead factor Get1/Grhl3, already known to be important for epidermal barrier formation. In the bladder, Get1 is most highly expressed in the differentiated umbrella cells and its mutation in mice leads to a defective bladder epithelial barrier formation due to failure of apical membrane specialization. Genes encoding components of the specialized urothelial membrane, the uroplakins, were downregulated in Get1-/- mice. At least one of these genes, Uroplakin II, is a direct target of Get1. The urothelial-specific activation of the Uroplakin II gene is due to selective binding of Get1 to the Uroplakin II promoter in urothelial cells, most likely regulated by histone modifications. These results demonstrate a key role for Get1 in urothelial differentiation and barrier formation. Experiment Overall Design: To gain insights into molecular mechanisms of bladder defects in Get1-/- mice, we profiled bladders of three Get1-/- and three Get +/- E18.5 mice.

Description
	
Curcumin has antileukemic potential that is mediated by dfifferent pathways. Because we could not confirm that the Arylhydrocarbonreceptor, a ligand activated transcription factor, is involved in curcumins antileukemic effects, we performed microarray experiments to have an overall screening of the pathways affected by curcumin in HL-60 cells. We identified an involvement of the vitamin D receptor in the effects of curcumin on HL-60 cells by comparing our results with other experiments. Experiment Overall Design: HL-60 cells were treated for 24h with 100 M curcumin, 10 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), or 0.5 % DMSO as control.

Description
	
In order to characterize the differences between second trimester Down syndrome (DS) and euploid fetuses, we compared gene expression in uncultured amniotic fluid supernatant samples. We identified individually differentially expressed genes via paired t-tests in the matched samples, and a set of differentially expressed genes on chromosome 21 using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Functional pathway analysis of the resulting genes highlighted the importance of oxidative stress, ion transport, and G-protein signaling in the DS fetuses. Experiment Overall Design: We profiled seven DS expression samples and seven controls matched for gender and approximate gestational age..

Description
	
Fruits of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cultivar MicroTom were investigated. MicroTom wild type and lecer6 mutant fruits with a deficiency in a fatty acid beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (LeCER6) were used. Identification and characterization of this insertional mutant has been reported previously (Vogg et al., 2004; Leide et al., 2007). According to the developmental stage of the wild type and lecer6 mutant fruits, samples were composed of 5 to 15 whole fruits with seeds being removed (fruit developmental category 'fruit set' and I). Otherwise, samples contained exclusively the fruit peel, which was removed with a scalpel to a depth of approximately 1 mm (fruit developmental category II to VII). After sampling point the plant material was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C until use.

Description
	
After a standard cultivation program of six weeks, tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cultivar MicroTom were grown under different conditions of atmospheric humidity and soil irrigation. The atmospheric humidity was adjusted to 40% and 80%, respectively. To regulate soil moisture, all potted plants were substrate saturated watered once a week. Furthermore, only a group of these plants was irrigated to assure optimally growing conditions (optimal watering conditions), whereas a second group had to cope with little water supply (no watering conditions). Mature green fruits were investigated (fruit developmental category II). Samples contained exclusively the fruit peel, which was removed with a scalpel to a depth of approximately 1 mm. After sampling point the plant material was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C until use.

Description
	
Despite their importance, plant MAP kinase targets are still poorly elucidated. Here, the specific in vivo interaction of an ethylene response factor (ERF104) with the Arabidopsis MAP kinase, MPK6, is shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The interaction, which is lost within minutes after treatment with the flagellin-derived flg22 peptide, is dependent on both MPK6 kinase activity and rapid ethylene signaling initiated downstream of MPK6 activation. ERF104 is an MPK6 substrate and phosphorylation site mutations affected its stability. ERF104 activates promoters with GCC elements. This was evident from microarray data of overexpressing transgenic plants, where promoters of up regulated genes contain GCC motifs and chromatin immunoprecipitation showing ERF104 association with PDF1.2 promoter. The ERF104 overexpressor did not affect biotrophic bacteria proliferation but was more susceptible to necrotrophic Botrytis cinerea. Microarray performed with erf104 or mpk6 revealed only a limited number of flg22-induced genes that require these elements - possibly as a; result of functional redundancies. Thus, ERF104 phosphorylation by MPK6, in concert with ethylene signaling induced by pathogen-derived molecules, modulates defense in Arabidopsis. Experiment Overall Design: Leaves of six week old Col-0, erf104, mpk6 and 35S::ERF104 plants were infiltrated with 1 M Flg22 or water and harvested four hours later. Total RNA was isolated and processed according to the Affymetrix protocol for biotin-labelled cRNA and hybridized to the Affymetrix ATH1 chip. The data Experiment Overall Design: was analyzed with Genespring GX 7.3.1 software (Agilent) with the following parameters: Filter on Flags for present or marginal in 50% of all considered experiments, Filter for reliable differentially expressed genes based on volcano plot (one way ANOVA p-value <0.05 and >3-fold change in expression). For the flg22 experiments, analysis for each genotype was separately performed and a composite list of flg22-regulated genes compiled with the aim of including genes that may be differentially regulated in the genotype. Global expression profile was visualized by k-means clustering and condition tree (Genespring).

Description
	
This study compared gene expression in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in atherosclerosis-prone and atherosclerosis-resistant regions of the aorta of C57Bl/6 mice. In a parallel experiment, both regions were compared in young, plaque-free apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Aortas of 3 male and 3 female C57Bl6 mice were isolated, perfused with triton X-100 to remove endothelial cells and divided in an atherosclerosis-prone region (AA: ascending aorta, aortic arch and proximal 2 mm of thoracic aorta) and an atherosclerosis-resistant region (TA: central thoracic aorta,i.e. 6 mm distal from the proximal 2mm of the thoracic aorta). Microarray analysis (VIB-MAF) of pooled total RNA showed differential expression (>2-fold difference) for 70 genes. Up- or downregulation in the AA was observed for 33 and 37 genes respectively. Differential expression of 3 genes (ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 1 polypeptide, sarcolipin and homeo box B7) was confirmed using real-time PCR. Twenty five genes showed exclusively differential expression in C57BL6 mice. Only 7 could be linked to specific processes: development (4) and cell growth (3). The other 18 genes were all involved in different processes. Among the 45 genes showing differential expression in C57Bl/6 as well as apoE-/- mice, most were related to development (13), cell growth (8) and transcription (10). These results point to an altered transcriptome in SMCs of the C57Bl/6 aorta at an atherosclerosis-prone location. This is in agreement with findings in endothelial cells in atherosclerosis-prone regions. It could be due to biomechanical differences, for instance in wall tension or shear stress, or the different embryological origin of SMCs in AA and TA. Experiment Overall Design: Samples were hybridized in dye-swap design.

Description
	
This study compared gene expression in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in atherosclerosis-prone and atherosclerosis-resistant aorta segments in 4 months old apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice before plaque development. In a parallel experiment, both regions were compared in young C57Bl/6 mice. Aortas of 3 male and 3 female ApoE-/- mice were isolated, perfused with triton X-100 to remove endothelial cells and divided in an atherosclerosis-prone region (AA: ascending aorta, aortic arch and proximal 2 mm of thoracic aorta) and a resistant region (TA: central thoracic aorta, i.e. 6 mm distal from the proximal 2 mm). Microarray analysis (VIB-MAF) of pooled total RNA showed differential expression (>2-fold difference) for 244 genes. Up- or downregulation in the AA was observed for 186 and 58 genes respectively. Differential expression of 6 genes was confirmed using real-time PCR. The 201 genes that showed exclusively differential expression in apoE-/- mice were related to processes involved in atherosclerosis, such as cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, motility and death, lipid metabolism and immune responses. Furthermore, the transcription profile of the AA was in accordance with a more synthetic SMC phenotype. These results point to an altered transcriptome in SMCs in the aorta of apoE-/- mice at the atherosclerosis-prone location before actual lesion development. This suggests that SMCs, in addition to endothelial cells, can facilitate plaque formation at predilection sites. Experiment Overall Design: samples were hyrbidized in dye-swap.

Description
	
Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome (OFCD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by teeth with extremely long roots (radiculomegaly), and craniofacial, eye and cardiac abnormalities. The mutation of the transcriptional co-repressor BCOR has been identified as being responsible for oculo-facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) syndrome. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is isolated from the root apical papilla of an OFCD patient. Gene expression profiling is performed and compared between mutant MSCs and wild type MSCs. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA were extracted from normal MSCs (MSCWT) and mutant MSCs (MSCO).

Description
	
The regulation of multipotent cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) expansion and subsequent differentiation into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, or endothelial cells is a fundamental aspect of basic cardiovascular biology and cardiac regenerative medicine. However, the mechanisms governing these decisions remain unclear. Here, we show that Wnt/ -Catenin signaling, which promotes expansion of CPCs, is negatively regulated by Notch1-mediated control of phosphorylated -Catenin accumulation within CPCs, and that Notch1 activity in CPCs is required for their differentiation. Notch1 positively, and -Catenin negatively, regulated expression of the cardiac transcription factors, Isl1, Myocd and Smyd1. Surprisingly, disruption of Isl1, normally expressed transiently in CPCs prior to their differentiation, resulted in expansion of CPCs in vivo and in an embryonic stem (ES) cell system. Furthermore, Isl1 was required for CPC differentiation into cardiomyocyte and smooth muscle cells, but not endothelial cells. These findings reveal a regulatory network controlling CPC expansion and cell fate that involve unanticipated functions of -Catenin, Notch1 and Isl1 that may be leveraged for regenerative approaches involving CPCs. Experiment Overall Design: YFP+ cells marking precardiac mesoderm (Isl1-cre domain) were FACS-sorted (w/wo stabilized Beta-catenin). Their total RNA was amplified with the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System, fragmented and labeled with the FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 (Nugen). The hybridization, staining and scanning of the Affymetrix GeneChips were performed in the Gladstone Genomics Core Lab. Raw data generated from at least three independent experiments were further analyzed by the group of Dr. Ru-Fang Yeh at the Center for Informatics and Molecular Biostatistics, UCSF.

Description
	
The effects of mercury (HgCl2) on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) growth, physiological traits and gene expression profiles were studied. The shoot to root ratio was decreased in the two levels of HgCl2 (500 and 1000 M) assayed, which was related primarily with decreases in shoot dry weight. Moreover stomatal conductance was limited and leaf carbon isotope discrimination decreased. Therefore water uptake limitations seem to be an important component of barley responses to HgCl2. Evidences for decreased stomatal conductance and water uptake limitations were further confirmed by the over expression of ABA related transcripts and down regulation of an aquaporin in roots. Root dry weight was only affected at 1000 M HgCl2 and root browning was observed, while several transcripts for lignin biosynthesis were up regulated in HgCl2. Microarray analysis further revealed that growth inhibition in HgCl2 was related to increased expression of genes participating in ethylene biosynthesis and down regulation of several genes participating in DNA synthesis, chromatin structure and cell division, cell wall degradation and modification, oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and nitrogen metabolism pathway. Genes involved in detoxification and defence mechanisms were up regulated including several cytochrome P450s, glucosyltransferases and glutathione-s-transferases and amino acid metabolism participatory genes. It is concluded that barley plants survive in the presence of HgCl2 through several mechanisms that include water uptake limitations, shoot and root growth regulation, increased expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of several plant protection secondary metabolites and finally through detoxification. Experiment Overall Design: Six samples were analysed including 3 biological replicates of mercury exposed roots and 3 controls (no mercury added to the growing solution)

Description
	
Drought tolerance is a key trait for increasing and stabilizing barley productivity in dry areas worldwide. Identification of the genes responsible for drought tolerance in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) will facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance, and also genetic improvement of barley through marker-assisted selection or gene transformation. To monitor the changes in gene expression at transcription levels in barley leaves during the reproductive stage under drought conditions, the 22K Affymetrix Barley 1 microarray was used to screen two drought-tolerant barley genotypes, Martin and Hordeum spontaneum 41-1 (HS41-1), and one drought-sensitive genotype Moroc9-75. Seventeen genes were expressed exclusively in the two drought-tolerant genotypes under drought stress, and their encoded proteins may play significant roles in enhancing drought tolerance through controlling stomatal closure via carbon metabolism (NADP malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), synthesizing the osmoprotectant glycine-betaine (C-4 sterol methyl oxidase (CSMO), generating protectants against reactive-oxygen-species scavenging (aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), ascorbate-dependant oxidoreductase (ADOR), and stabilizing membranes and proteins (heat-shock protein 17.8 (HSP17.8) and dehydrin 3 (DHN3). Moreover, 17 genes were abundantly expressed in Martin and HS41-1 compared with Moroc9-75 under both drought and control conditions. These genes were likely constitutively expressed in drought-tolerant genotypes. Among them, 7 known annotated genes might enhance drought tolerance through signaling (such as calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) and membrane steroid binding protein (MSBP), anti-senescence (G2 pea dark accumulated protein GDA2) and detoxification (glutathione S-transferase (GST) pathways. In addition, 18 genes, including those encoding l-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), protein phosphatase 2C-like protein (PP2C) and several chaperones, were differentially expressed in all genotypes under drought; thus, they were more likely general drought-responsive genes in barley. These results could provide new insights into further understanding of drought-tolerance mechanisms in barley. Experiment Overall Design: Seven flag leaves of a replication for each genotype were harvested at 0 d, 1 d, 3 d and 5 d after reach 10% of AWC in the soil to constitute a single biological replicate. These flag leaves were employed for RNA isolation by using Trizol reagent following the manufacturer s protocol (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The RNA was further purified using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA yield and quality were determined by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Techologies, Boblingen, Germany). Experiment Overall Design: A table of the average, log2 RMA signal intensity values of three biological replicates for each Sample is linked below as a supplementary file.

Description
	
Mutations in the SFTPC gene associated with interstitial lung disease in human patients result in misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, and degradation of the encoded surfactant protein C (SP-C) proprotein. To identify candidate genes involved in ER quality control of SP-C, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with mutant SP-C (SP-C exon4 or SP-CL188Q), SP-CWT, or vector cDNAs, and global changes in gene expression were assessed by microarray analyses. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the SPC exon 4 deletion and SPC L188Q mutations invoke very similar transcriptional profiles including the activation of major players mediating ER response and unfolding protein response (UPR) in transient transfection system. In combination with promoter scan (UPRE, ERSE, XBP1 sites) and protein domain analysis (Finding ER Lumen, ER Membrane retention signal, J-Domain and Leucine Zipper domain), we were able to not only verify the known ERAD components (XBP1, Bip, Erdj4&5), but also identify multiple ER components which may play critical roles in the detection and /or degradation of mutant SPC, which in turn will help us to gain better understanding of the entire mammalian ERAD machinery. Experiment Overall Design: samples consisted of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with wild-type SP-C (WT), the delta exon4 mutant of SP-C (Ex4) or L188Q mutant Experiment Overall Design: of SP-C (LQ). Groups were performed in triplicate.

Description
	
Sex determination is still poorly understood in birds and no key determinants have so far been identified. In contrast to most other species, dosage compensation of bird sex chromosomal genes appears rather ineffective. By comparing microarrays of microdissected primitive streak from single chicken embryos, we identified a large number of genes differentially expressed between male and female embryos at a very early stage (Hamburger and Hamilton stage 4), long before any sexual differentiation occurs. Most of these genes are located on the Z chromosome, which indicates that dosage compensation is ineffective in early chicken embryos. Gene ontology analyses using an enhanced annotation tool for Affymetrix probesets of the chicken genome shows that among the male-biased genes found on the Z chromosome, more than 20 genes have a role in sex differentiation. Experiment Overall Design: Primitive streak tissues were dissected out of individual Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 4 chicken embryos and extracted for total RNA. Total RNA was amplified 2-cycles, biotin-labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix chicken GeneChip. Gene expression profiles of female and male samples were analyzed for sex-dimorphic expression.

Description
	
Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial to maintain lifelong production of all blood cells. Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin(-)Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48(-)CD34(-) population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress Experiment Overall Design: cDNA microarray analysis was performed on sorted mouse bone marrow after 170 days of doxycycline treatment for CD34 Neg, Lin Neg, Sca1+, cKit+, CD150+, CD48 Neg, HSCs. HSCs were further sorted for GFP+ (LRC) and GFP neg (non-LRC) populations. Per condition, 3 independent biological replicates were analysed.

Description
	
The small G-protein KRAS is crucial for mediating gonadotropin-induced events associated with ovulation. However, constitutive expression of KrasG12D in granulosa cells disrupted normal follicle development leading to the persistence of abnormal follicle-like structures containing non-mitotic cells. To determine what factors mediate this potent effect of KrasG12D, gene profiling analyses were done. We also analyzed KrasG12D;Cyp19-Cre and KrasG12D;Pgr-Cre mutant mouse models that express Cre prior to or after the initiation of granulosa cell differentiation, respectively. KrasG12D induced cell cycle arrest in granulosa cells of the KrasG12D;Cyp19-Cre mice but not in the KrasG12D;Pgr-Cre mice, documenting the cell context specific effect of KrasG12D. Expression of KrasG12D silenced the Kras gene, reduced cell cycle activator genes and impaired expression of granulosa cell and oocyte specific genes. Conversely, levels of PTEN and phosphorylated p38MAPK increased markedly in the mutant granulosa cells. Because disrupting Pten in granulosa cells leads to increased proliferation and survival, Pten was disrupted in the KrasG12D mutant mice. The Pten/Kras mutant mice were infertile but lacked GCTs. By contrast, the Ptenfl/fl;KrasG12D;Amhr2-Cre mice developed aggressive ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cell tumors that did not occur in the Ptenfl/fl;KrasG12D;Cyp19-Cre or Ptenfl/fl;KrasG12D;Pgr-Cre mouse strains. These data document unequivocally that Amhr2-Cre is expressed in and mediates allelic recombination of oncogenic genes in OSE cells. That KrasG12D/Pten mutant granulosa cells do not transform but rather undergo cell cycle arrest indicates that they resist the oncogenic insults of Kras/Pten by robust self-protecting mechanisms that silence the Kras gene and elevate PTEN and phospho-p38MAPK. Experiment Overall Design: Whole ovaries were collected from 26-day-old wild type mice, 26-day-old K-ras conditional mutant mice and 3-month-old K-ras conditional mutant mice. The gene expression profiles of these samples were compared using microarray method.

Description
	
Echo-contrast agents enhance the echogenicity of ultrasound and have been clinically used for diagonosis in current medical fields. Here, the combined effects of Sonazoid, an echo-contrast agent, and ultrasound on the gene expression in human lymphoma U937 cells were investigated using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. The cells were treated with Sonazoid (0.05%; Sonazoid only), ultrasound (0.3 W/cm2 for 1 min; ultrasound only) and the combination of Sonazoid and ultrasound (0.05% Sonazoid plus ultrasound 0.3 W/cm2 for 1 min; Sonazoid + Ultrasound) and followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 C. The percentage of DNA fragmentation 6 h after treatment was 5.8 1.0 (mean SD, n = 3), 6.0 0.4, 13.5 1.0, and 18.3 2.3 in cells treated with control, Sonazoid only, ultrasound only and Sonazoid + Ultrasound, respectively. Of approximately 47,000 probe sets analyzed, probe sets that were differentially expressed by a factor 2.0 or greater were 40, 184 and 144 in cells treated with Sonazoid only, ultrasound only and Sonazoid + Ultrasound, respectively. Experiment Overall Design: U937 cells, a human lymphoma cell line, were treated with Sonazoid (0.05%), ultrasound (0.3 W/cm2 for 1 min) and the combination of Sonazoid and ultrasound (0.05% Sonazoid plus ultrasound 0.3 W/cm2 for 1 min) and followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 C. Non-treated cells were served as control. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer s instructions.

Description
	
A SNP microarray and FISH-based procedure to detect allelic imbalances in multiple myeloma: an integrated genomics approach reveals a wide dosage effect on gene and microRNA expression; Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by marked genomic instability. Beyond structural rearrangements, a relevant role in its biology is represented by allelic imbalances leading to significant variations in ploidy status. To better elucidate the genomic complexity of MM, we analyzed a panel of 45 patients using combined FISH and microarray approaches. Using a self-developed procedure to infer exact local copy numbers for each sample, we identified a significant fraction of patients showing marked aneuploidy. A conventional clustering analysis showed that aneuploidy, chromosome 1 alterations, hyperdiploidy and recursive deletions at 1p and chromosomes 13, 14 and 22 were the main aberrations driving samples grouping. Then, we integrated mapping information with gene and microRNAs expression profiles: a multiclass analysis of the identified clusters showed a marked gene-dosage effect, particularly concerning 1q transcripts, also confirmed by correlating gene expression levels and local copy number alterations. A wide dosage effect affected also microRNAs, indicating that structural abnormalities in MM closely reflect in their expression imbalances. Finally, we identified several loci in which genes and microRNAs expression correlated with loss-of-heterozygosity occurrence. Our results provide insights into the composite network linking genome structure and gene/microRNA transcriptional features in MM. Experiment Overall Design: Pathological bone marrow specimens from 41 MM and four plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients at diagnosis. 250 nanograms of genomic DNA was processed and, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols, 40 micrograms of fragmented biotin-labelled DNA were hybridized on GeneChip Human Mapping 50K XbaI Arrays (Affymetrix Inc.). The arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. The images were acquired using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data. FBN procedure was finally applied to infer exact local copy number as described in the mentioned Reference.

Description
	
The origin and function of human double negative (DN) TCR-alpha/beta T cells is unknown. They are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus because they expand and accumulate in inflamed organs. Here we provide evidence that human TCR-alpha/beta CD4- CD8- DN T cells derive exclusively from activated CD8+ T cells. Freshly isolated TCR-alpha/beta DN T cells display a distinct gene expression and cytokine production profile. DN cells isolated from peripheral blood as well as DN cells derived in vitro from CD8+ T cells, produce a defined array of pro-inflammatory mediators that includes IL-1, IL-17, IFN-gama, CXCL3, and CXCL2. These results indicate that, upon activation, CD8+ T cells have the capacity to acquire a distinct phenotype that grants them inflammatory capacity. Experiment Overall Design: TCR-alpha-beta+ CD25- T cells from healthy human individuals were sorted into CD4+, CD8+, and CD4-CD8- T cells. Cell lysis and RNA extraction was performed immediately. RNA from each cell subset was pooled.

Description
	
Effects of Nipped-B and Rad21 sister chromatid cohesin proteins on gene expression data in ML-DmBG3 cells derived from Drosophila melanogaster larval central nervous system; We examined the effects of Nipped-B and Rad21 knockdown on gene expression in BG3 cells using microarrays that measure over 18,700 transcripts to (a) determine if the effects of cohesion on E(spl)-C and invected-engrailed expression are unique, (b) look for effects of cohesin on regulators of E(spl)-C and engrailed, and (c) obtain a comprehensive view of the effects of cohesin on gene expression. Experiment Overall Design: Effects of cohesin knockdown on E(spl)-C and invected-engrailed transcription vary over time, so we used two independent samples for three days after RNAi treatment, one four day and one six day sample for both Nipped-B and Rad21 knockdown, and mock RNAi controls for each time point. Experiment Overall Design: For RNAi treatment, cells were plated at 5x106 cells per 3 cm well. Media was replaced with 1 ml of Express Five SFM (Invitrogen) with 1% FCS, and 10 micrograms per ml insulin. The indicated amount of dsRNA was added per well. Media was adjusted to 3 ml and 10% FCS with Schneider s media after 2 hrs. Cells were replated as needed. Templates for dsRNA synthesis were made by PCR from cDNA templates using primers with T7 promoters (see supplementary file linked below). Equal amounts of two dsRNAs against each target were used.

Description
	
Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling activation by pathogens is critical to the induction of immune responses, and demands tight regulation. Chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) secretion triggered by TLR4 or TLR8 engagement is strongly inhibited upon simultaneous activation of both TLRs in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MD-DC). Impaired CCL2 secretion occurs concomitantly to IL-12 up-regulation, being part of a complex regulatory circuit ensuring optimal Th type 1 polarization. Interestingly, triggering selected TLRs or their combinations differently affects nuclear factor-kB p65 activation and microRNA expression. To investigate in details such different modulation we performed a microarray profiling of MD-DCs stimulated by different TLRs agonist or their combination in three different donors. We found that CCL2 supplies an important immunomodulatory role to DCs, and may contribute to dictate the cytokine profile in Th type 1 responses induced by DCs.

Description
	
The purpose of this study was to characterize the gene expression profile of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with various SCFA-hexosamine analogs to better understand the role of various modifications to this scaffold. Experiment Overall Design: In total, six analogs were investigated in this study. For the relatively "toxic" C6-SCFA analogs, IC30 was selected to explore initial growth inhibitory and apoptotic gene expression changes. Two independent biological replicates were analyzed for each analog-treated condition. Three independent biological replicates were analyzed for the vehicle-treated control (EtOH).

Description
	
The anx/anx mouse displays poor appetite and lean appearance and is considered a good model for the study of anorexia nervosa. To identify new genes involved in feeding behavior and body weight regulation we performed an expression profiling in the hypothalamus of the anx/anx mice. Using commercial microarrays we detected 156 differentially expressed genes and validated 92 of those using TaqMan low-density arrays. Our results showed an enrichment of deregulated genes involved in cell death, cell morphology and cancer as well as an alteration of several signaling circuits involved in energy balance including neuropeptide Y and melanocortin signaling. The expression profile along with the phenotype let us to conclude that anx/anx mice resemble the anorexia-cachexia syndrome typically observed in cancer, infection with human immunodeficiency virus or chronic diseases rather than starvation, and that anx/anx mice could be considered a good model for the treatment and investigation of this condition. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA expression profile comparison between 3 pairs of anx/anx mice and wild type littermates in brain hypothalamus and neocortex

Description
	
We investigated the regulation of adipose tissue (AT) gene expression during different phases of a dietary weight loss program and its relationship with insulin sensitivity. Obese women followed a weight reduction program composed of an energy restriction phase (ER) with a 4-week very-low-calorie diet and a weight stabilization period (WS) composed of a 2-month low-calorie diet followed by 3 to 4 months of a weight maintenance diet. At each time point, body composition, plasma parameters and glucose disposal rate were assessed and subcutaneous AT biopsies were performed. Variations in mRNA levels were determined using DNA microarrays and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Distinct sets of AT genes are regulated during calorie restriction and weight stabilization revealing an unexpected temporal pattern in the link between AT and insulin sensitivity during weight loss. Experiment Overall Design: Fifteen obese premenopausal women were recruited at the Third Faculty of Medicine of Charles University and at the Institute for Mother and Child Care in Prague, Czech Republic. During the first four weeks of the dietary intervention program, the subjects received an energy restricted diet of 800 kcal/day (liquid formula diet, Redita, Promil). During the next two months, a low-calorie diet was designed to provide 600 kcal/day less than the individually estimated energy requirement based on an initial resting metabolic rate multiplied by 1.3. Following this, subjects entered a weight maintenance phase for a period of 3 to 4 months, during which the patients were instructed to keep their weight stable. A complete clinical investigation in the fasting state was realized before and at the end of each phase. Needle microbiopsy of subcutaneous AT was performed under local anesthesia (1% Xylocaine) from the abdominal region (14 20 cm lateral to the umbilicus). Total RNA were isolated from AT samples with Qiagen RNeasy kit. RNA quantity and quality were checked with the Experion automated electrophoresis system (BioRad laboratories). We performed a whole transcriptome analysis comparing 1) before vs. after the initial 4 weeks severe energy restriction (ER), 2) after energy restriction vs. after weight stabilization (WS) and 3) before dietary intervention vs. after weight stabilization (DI). Eight subjects representative of the cohort were selected, matched for high quality of total RNA samples, insulin sensitivity and weight changes during the study. Targets for microarray experiments were generated from 500 ng of total RNA with Agilent low RNA input amplification kit (Agilent Technologies) and hybridized to whole genome 44k oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent Technologies). Each combination of samples was analyzed twice using a dye swap design (i.e., a total of 48 hybridizations). Data acquisition from microarrays was obtained with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon instruments) and image processing was performed with Feature Extraction 8.5 (Agilent Technologies). Raw data were normalized with a global Lowess procedure and filtered with R package LIMMA (Bioconductor). Outlier replicates and spots with a signal to noise ratio lesser than 2 on both red and green channel were eliminated from our analyses. Mean log ratios were calculated from paired duplicates before normalization. Differentially expressed genes were identified with Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) procedure.

Description
	
Brain metastasis is one of the most feared complications of cancer and the most common intracranial malignancy in adults. Its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. From breast cancer patients with metastatic disease we isolated cell populations that aggressively colonize the brain. Transcriptomic analysis of these cells yielded overlapping gene sets whose expression is selectively associated with brain metastasis. The expression of seventeen of these genes in primary breast tumors is associated with brain relapse in breast cancer patients. Some of these genes are also associated with metastasis to lung but not to liver, bone or lymph nodes, providing a molecular basis for the long-observed clinical link between brain and lung metastasis. Among the functionally validated brain metastasis genes, the cyclooxygenase COX-2, the EGFR ligand HB-EGF, and the brain-specific 2-6 sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC5 mediate cancer cell passage through the blood-brain barrier. Other brain metastasis genes encode inflammatory factors and brain-specific proteolytic regulators, suggesting a multifaceted program for breast cancer colonization of the brain. Experiment Overall Design: Two different breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and freshly isolated pleural effusion CN34 were used in this study. The MDA-MB-231 group contains three biological replicates of the parental, unselected population, and 4 brain metastatic isolates. CN34 contains 2 biological replicates of the parental, unselected population, and 4 brain metastatic isolates. In each case, the parental population was compared to the brain metastatic isolates to identify gene expression changes associated with the brain metastatic phenotype.

Description
	
STAT3 is a transcription factor playing a crucial role in inflammation, immunity and oncogenesis, able to induce distinct subsets of target genes in different cell types or under different conditions. Identification of direct transcriptional targets however has only defined a relatively limited set of genes, not sufficient to explain its variegated functions. In order to improve our understanding of the STAT3 transcriptional network we decided to develop a computational approach for the discovery of STAT3 functional binding sites. Upon generating a Positional Weight Matrix to define STAT3 binding sites, we applied a loglikelihood ratio scoring function and were able to assign affinity scores with very high specificity (93.5%) as measured by EMSA. STAT3 binding sites scoring above a stringent threshold have been identified genome-wide in Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and selected for phylogenetic conservation by genomic sequence alignment using eight vertebrate species. Validation was carried out on a subset of predicted; sites within genes previously identified as STAT3-responsive by microarray analysis. The high percentage of sites able to bind STAT3 in vivo, as assessed by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, revealed the high predictive power of our method. Experiment Overall Design: Three prototypic situation were investigated using two replications for each experimental point: STAT3+/+ versus STAT3-/- MEFs , STAT3+/+ versus STAT3+/+ treated with OSM and STAT3-/- versus STAT3-/- treated with OSM.

Description
	
Targeting oncogene addiction is a promising strategy for anti-cancer therapy. Here, we report a potent inhibition of crucial oncogenes by p53 upon reactivation with small molecule RITA in vitro and in vivo. RITA-activated p53 unleashes transcriptional repression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2, MAP4, and survivin, blocks Akt pathway on several levels and downregulates c-Myc, cyclin E and B-catenin. p53 ablates c-Myc expression via several mechanisms at transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. We show that transrepression of oncogenes correlated with higher level of p53 bound to chromatin-bound p53 than transactivation of pro-apoptotic targets. Inhibition of oncogenes by p53 reduces the cell s ability to buffer pro-apoptotic signals and elicits robust apoptosis. Our study highlights the role of transcriptional repression for p53-mediated tumor suppression. Experiment Overall Design: Breast carcinoma cell-line MCF7 was treated with the small-molecule p53 activator RITA for 2h, 8h, 16h and 24h.

Description
	
Most of the transcriptional changes induced by PFOS in the fetal mouse liver and lung were related to activation of PPARalpha. When compared to the transcript profiles induced by PFOA (Pubmed ID 17681415), few remarkable differences were found other than up-regulation of Cyp3a genes. Because PFOS and PFOA have been shown to differ in their mode of action in the murine neonate, these data suggest that changes related to PFOS-induced neonatal toxicity may not be evident in the fetal transcriptome at term. Experiment Overall Design: Thirty timed-pregnant CD-1 mice were orally dosed from gestation day 1-17 with either 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day PFOS in 0.5% Tween 20. At term, fetal lung and liver were collected, total RNA prepared, and samples pooled from three fetuses per litter. Five biological replicates consisting of individual litter samples were then evaluated for each treatment group using Affymetrix mouse 430_2 microarrays.

Description
	
Spontaneous cell fusion of MDA-MB-231 bone-metastatic subline Bm (i.e., SCP2) and lung metastatic subline Lm (i.e., LM2) gave rise to hybrid lines BLm-FACS or BLm-DRUG, as well as its single clones (#8, #12, #18). The hybrids acquired the metastasis tropisms from both parental cells. Expression profiles of the parental cells, the hybrids and several previously characterized MDA-MB-231 metastatic derivatives were compared. Hierarchical clustering showed the hybrids assimilated the organ-specific metastasis gene signatures from both parental cells. Experiment Overall Design: Twenty-six cell lines were analyzed, including the parental line MDA-MB-231; cell fusion partner lines Bm and Lm; self-fused lines BBm and LLm; hetero-fused lines BLm-FACS, BLM-DRUG and clones BLm-DRUG-8, -12 and -18; strongly bone-metastatic lines 1833, SCP14, SCP20, SCP25 and SCP46; strongly lung-metastatic lines 3481, 4142, 4173, 4175 and 4180; and weakly metastatic lines SCP3, SCP4, SCP6, SCP28, SCP32 and SCP43. Single sample for each line.

Description
	
In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) an important contingent of dopaminergic neurons are localized in the substantia nigra and in the ventral tegmental area of the ventral midbrain. They constitute an anatomically and functionally heterogeneous group of cells involved in a variety of regulatory mechanisms, from locomotion to emotional/motivational behavior. Midbrain dopaminergic neuron (mDA) primary cultures represent a useful tool to study molecular mechanisms involved in their development and maintenance. Considerable information has been gathered on the mDA neurons development and maturation in vivo, as well as on the molecular features of mDA primary cultures. Here we investigated in detail the gene expression differences between the tissue of origin and ventral midbrain primary cultures enriched in mDA neurons, using microarray technique. We integrated the results based on different re-annotations of the microarray probes. By using knowledge-based gene network techniques and promoter sequence analysis, we also uncovered mechanisms that might regulate the expression of CNS genes involved in the definition of the identity of specific cell types in the ventral midbrain. We integrate bioinformatics and functional genomics, together with developmental neurobiology. Moreover, we propose guidelines for the computational analysis of microarray gene expression data. Our findings help to clarify some molecular aspects of the development and differentiation of DA neurons within the midbrain. Experiment Overall Design: 9 microarrays used. MesE11 x 3; MesPC x 6.

Description
	
STAT3 is a pleiotropic transcription factor with important functions in cytokine signalling in a variety of tissues. However, the role of STAT3 in the intestinal epithelium is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that development of colonic inflammation is associated with the induction of STAT3 activity in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Studies in genetically engineered mice showed that epithelial STAT3 activation in DSS colitis is dependent on IL-22 rather than IL-6. IL-22 was secreted by colonic CD11c+ cells in response to Toll-like receptor stimulation. Conditional knockout mice with an IEC specific deletion of STAT3 activity were highly susceptible to experimental colitis, indicating that epithelial STAT3 regulates gut homeostasis. STAT3IEC-KO mice, upon induction of colitis, showed a striking defect of epithelial restitution. Gene chip analysis indicated that STAT3 regulates the cellular stress response, apoptosis and pathways associated with wound healing in IEC. Consistently, both IL-22 and epithelial STAT3 were found to be important in wound-healing experiments in vivo. In summary, our data suggest that intestinal epithelial STAT3 activation regulates immune homeostasis in the gut by promoting IL-22-dependent mucosal wound healing. Experiment Overall Design: 4 samples of colon epithelium were analyzed from 4 mice (2 per group Stat3flfl VillinCre- and Stat3flfl VillinCre+, respectively) after they had been treated with DSS (2.5%) for 5 days

Description
	
To obtain a genomic view of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4 ) in the regulation of the inflammatory response, microarray analysis was used to probe the expression profile of an inflammatory response induced by cytokines in a model of knock-down HNF-4 HepG2 cells. The results indicate an extensive role for HNF-4 plays in the regulation of a large number of the liver-specific genes. Majority of genes (71%) affected by cytokine treatment are also affected by HNF-4 knock-down. This significant overlap suggests that HNF-4 may play a role in regulating the cytokine-induced inflammatory response. Experiment Overall Design: The different treated HepG2 cells were grouped into 4 groups (four replicates in each group): Group1, Control; Group2, HNF-4 shRNA treated cells; Group3, cytokine treated group; Group4, HNF-4 shRNA and cytokine treatments. RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays were processed. The expression profiles between different groups were analyzed and compared. In order to explore the function of HNF-4 in the inflammatory response, a set of 170 genes annotated as inflammatory response was obtained from GO (geneotology.org), the enrichments of these inflammatory genes were analyzed in different treated groups.

Description
	
The adult human lung has a very limited capacity to regenerate functional alveoli. In contrast, adult mice have a remarkable capacity for neoalveolarization following either lung resection or injury. The molecular basis for this unique capability to regenerate lung tissue in mice is largely unknown. We examined the transcriptomic responses to single lung pneumonectomy in adult mice in order to elucidate prospective molecular signaling used in this species during lung regeneration. Unilateral left pneumonectomy or sham thoracotomy was performed under general anesthesia (n = 8 mice per group for each of the four time points). Total RNA was isolated from the remaining lung tissue at four time points post-surgery (6 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days) and analyzed using microarray technology. The observed transcriptomic patterns revealed mesenchymal cell signaling, including up-regulation of genes previously associated with activated fibroblasts (Tnfrsf12a, Tnc, Eln, Col3A1), as well as modulation of Igf1-mediated signaling. The data set also revealed early down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts, up-regulation of genes involved in T cell development and function, but few similarities to transcriptomic patterns observed during embryonic or post-natal lung development. Immunohistochemical analysis suggests that early fibroblast but not myofibroblast proliferation is important during lung regeneration and may explain the preponderance of mesenchymal-associated genes that are over-expressed in this model. This appears to differ from embryonic alveologenesis. These data suggest that modulation of mesenchymal cell signaling and proliferation may act in concert with immunomodulation to control inflammation during post-pneumonectomy lung regeneration in adult mice. Experiment Overall Design: For each of the four time points (6 hr, 1 day, 3 day, 7 day), the mice were divided into two groups: (1) pneumonectomy (PNY) and (2) sham operated (SHAM - thoracotomy without lung resection), with eight animals in each group. One microarray was performed on pooled lung tissue from these 8 animals for each time point. Analysis of expression in PNY vs SHAM animals was performed in two ways: using all four microarrays as replicates in a time-independent analysis, as well as analysis of each time point separately (time-dependent) without replicates.

Description
	
In order to identify patterns of gene expression associated with biological effects in THP-1 cells induced by F3, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the THP-1 control and F3-treated THP-1 cells by oligonucleotide microarray Experiment Overall Design: 10^7 cells/mL concentrations of THP-1 cells were seeded in 100 mm dish and incubated overnight. After that, cells were treated with F3 at a final concentration of 30 ug/mL. After incubated for 6 and 24 hours, the cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 250g for 5 min, correspondingly. Controlled samples of un-induced cells were treated in the same way with the same amount of medium.

Description
	
The gene expression profile of blood drawn from healthy individuals was studied over a period of six months, at five time points. The gene expression profiles appeared to be constant over one month and to slightly vary over three months. A small proportion of genes were found to be differentially regulated according to gender. Differential gene regulation by age (in subjects 25 55 years of age versus subjects > 55 years of age) was not observed. Experiment Overall Design: Healthy subjects were enrolled at a single site, their health status was determined by medical history, physical examination, and standard laboratory test values. Venous blood was drawn in the morning, from fasted subjects at five time points (Day1, Day14, Day28, Day 90 and Day 180). Blood was collected into PAXgene tubes (Becton-Dickinson Diagnostics; Hombrechtikon, Switzerland).

Description
	
Severe asthma exacerbations in children requiring hospitalisation are typically associated with viral infection, and occur almost exclusively amongst atopics, but the significance of these comorbidities is unknown. We hypothesised that underlying interactions between immunoinflammatory pathways related to responses to aeroallergen and virus are involved, and that evidence of these interactions is detectable in circulating cells during exacerbations. To address this hypothesis we used a genomics-based approach involving profiling of PBMC subpopulations collected during acute exacerbation versus convalescence by microarray and flow cytometry. Experiment Overall Design: The study design consisted of 25 atopic subjects, divided into 5 different pools, with each pool containing equal amounts of RNA from 5 subjects, either at acute exacerbation or convalscent stage.

Description
	
Background. Chronic fatiguing illness remains a poorly understood syndrome of unknown pathogenesis. We attempted to identify biomarkers for chronic fatiguing illness using microarrays to query the transcriptome in peripheral blood leukocytes. Methods. Cases were 44 individuals who were clinically evaluated and found to meet standard international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue, and controls were their monozygotic co-twins who were clinically evaluated and never had even one month of impairing fatigue. Biological sampling conditions were standardized and RNA stabilizing media were used. These methodological features provide rigorous control for bias resulting from case-control mismatched ancestry and experimental error. Individual gene expression profiles were assessed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Findings. There were no significant differences in gene expression for any transcript. Conclusions. Contrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify a biomarker for chronic fatiguing illness in the transcriptome of peripheral blood leukocytes suggesting that positive findings in prior studies may have resulted from experimental bias. Experiment Overall Design: Cases were 44 individuals who were clinically evaluated and found to meet standard international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue, and controls were their monozygotic co-twins who were clinically evaluated and never had even one month of impairing fatigue.

Description
	
To examine whether the local carbon ion radiotherapy affects the characteristics of the metastatic tumors, the expression profiles of the primary tumors and the lung metastases were studied in a mouse squamous cell carcinoma model by applying local radiotherapy with no irradiation (negative control), gamma-ray irradiation (reference beam), and carbon-ion irradiation. Experiment Overall Design: A highly metastatic mouse squamous cell carcinoma NR-S1 was implanted into the hind leg of synergetic C3H/HeNrs mice and irradiated with 5 Gy of carbon ion beam. 8 Gy of gamma ray was used as a reference beam. At 2 weeks after the irradiation, the lung tissue was sampled. In order to collect samples of primary tumors, the tumors were implanted in other mice and irradiated in the same manner, and the primary tumors were collected at 1 week after the irradiation. The tumor cells of the primary and metastatic tumors were collected by laser microdissection, and oligonucleotide microarray analysis of the irradiated primary tumors and the metastatic tumors were all performed in comparison to the non-irradiated primary tumor by two-color methods.

Description
	
CHD8 is a putative chromatin remodeling ATPase of the SNF2 family. We found that depletion of CHD8 impairs cell proliferation. In order to identify CHD8 target genes, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of CHD8-depleted cells. CHD8 was knockdown by doxycyclin-dependent expression of a shRNA that target the CHD8 mRNA. Experiment Overall Design: C33KD2 is a stable cell line where expression of a shRNA, that targets the CHD8 mRNA, is dependent on doxycycline. Addition of doxyclycin provokes a significant reduction in the level of CHD8 protein. Total RNA samples coming from C33KD2 cells cultured for 48 hours either with or without 2 g/ml doxycycline were used to generate complementary RNA labelled with Cy5 with the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies). The reference sample was Stratagene human universal reference and was amplified at the same time as the sample RNA using the same method. Reference samples were labeled using Cy3.

Description
	
Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a progressive chronic bladder disease with an increasing incidence. Today, IC is diagnosed by subjective symptoms in combination with cystoscopic and histologic evidence. The ultimate goal is the development of a diagnostic assay for IC on a molecular level. A comparative gene expression profile of bladder biopsies from patients with IC and control patients identified candidate marker genes for IC. Experiment Overall Design: Five IC patients and six control patients ('healthy') have been selected for the study. All IC patients had Hunner's ulcers and, with the exception of one person, also glomerulations, whereas the control group did not show these cystoscopic findings. From each IC patient two biopsies have been taken, one from an ulcerated area of the bladder ('ulcus'), and one from an area that macroscopically looked 'normal', 'not-inflamed' or not hyperemic ('ni'). One 'ni' sample has been excluded from the study because it had an expression pattern similar to the healthy controls.

Comparative gene expression analysis of two wine yeast strains at three time points (days 2, 5 and 14) during fermentation of colombar must. In our study we conducted parallel fermentations with the VIN13 and BM45 wine yeast strains in two different media, namely MS300 (syntheticmust) and Colombar must. The intersection of transcriptome datasets from both MS300 (simulated wine must;GSE11651) and Colombar fermentations should help to delineate relevant and noisy changes in gene expression in response to experimental factors such as fermentation stage and strain identity. Experiment Overall Design: Two industrial wine yeast strains (BM45 and VIN13) grown micro-aerobically in Colombar must. Microarray analysis was performed at three time points during fermentation (days 2, 5 and 14), representing the exponential, early and late stationary growth phases respectively.

Description
	
Stromal contamination is one of the major confounding factors in the analysis of primary solid tumor samples by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. As we propose to employ genome-wide SNP microarray analysis as a diagnostic platform for neuroblastoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these studies must be optimized. In order to investigate the effects of stroma, we derived early passage cell lines from nine primary tumors and compared their genomic signature with that of the primary tumors by 100K SNP array analysis. The average concordance between tumor and cell line for raw LOH (loss of heterozygosity) calls was 96% (range 91%-99%) and for raw copy number alterations (CNA), 71% (range 43%-87%). In general, there were a larger number of LOH events identified in the cell lines compared to the matched tumor samples (mean increase 3.2% 1.9%). We have developed an algorithm that shows that the presence of stroma contributes to under-reporting of LOH and copy number loss (CNL). Notable findings in this sample set were uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome arms 11p, 1q, 14q, and 15q and a novel area of amplification on chromosome band 11p15. Our analysis demonstrates that LOH was identified significantly more often in derived cell lines compared to the original tumor samples. While these may in part be due to clonal selection during adaptation to tissue culture, our study indicates contamination by normal stromal elements may be a major contributing factor in underestimation of LOH and CNL events. Experiment Overall Design: Nine human neuroblastoma tumor samples with paired blood samples and derivative cell lines

Description
	
To identify Six1 target genes, we chose the mK4 cell line that represents later metanephric mesenchyme of the embryonic kidney. The cells were infected with adenovirus vectors (AxCAwt) overexpressing VP16-Six1wt or VP16-Six1W171R and cultured for 24h. Total RNA was extracted using Isogen reagent (Nippon Gene), treated with RNase-free DNase (Roche Diagnostics) and purified with RNeasy Midi Kit (QIAGEN). Poly A+ RNA was selected using Oligotex-dT30 latex beads (TaKaRa). Poly A+ RNA (20 g) was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer in the presence of aminoallyl dUTP without the addition of spike-in controls. Then, single-stranded cDNAs were coupled with Cy3 (AxCAwt VP16-Six1wt infected sample) or Cy5 (AxCAwt VP16-Six1W171R infected sample) dyes, and the labeled probes were purified with QIAquick PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN). Hybridization to the microarray was carried out at 65 C for 17h according to the manufacturer's instruction. The arrays were washed, dried and scanned using ScanArray 5000 (GSI Lumonics) at two different PMT voltage settings (high and low) to avoid signal saturation. Cy3 and Cy5 intensities for each spot on the array were determined by QuantArray software (Version 3.0.0.0, GSI Lumonics). The raw data thus obtained was processed and the Cy3 to Cy5 ratios were calculated as follows: 1) subtraction of the fluorescence intensity of negative control spots as background from the intensity of each of the Cy3 and Cy5 spots, 2) normalization of the entire data set using the global normalization method, 3) elimination of spots with high background intensity for either dye, and 4) determination of the Cy3 to Cy5 ratios. To identify Six4 target genes, we chose the mK4 cell line that represents later metanephric mesenchyme of the embryonic kidney. The cells were infected with adenovirus vectors (AxCAwt) overexpressing VP16-Six4wt or VP16-Six4W263R and cultured for 24h.

Description
	
Male embryos are reported to develop faster than female in the preimplantation stage. Therefore, male and female embryos can be considered phenotypically different as early as the preimplantation stage. Employing our sexing system of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagging X chromosomes, we compared the global gene expression pattern of male and female embryos at the blastocyst stage using DNA microarray. Experiment Overall Design: samples were collected from three independent preparations and the experiments were triplicated. Scanned microarray results were processed with Feature Extraction software (ver. 7.5, Agilent). The hybridization experiments were duplicated in a reciprocal labeling manner to reduce dye integration bias, and total of six hybridizations were carried out for the entire analysis. Combining plural array results and statistical analyses were carried out by Luminator software (Rosetta).

Description
	
Background; The gut is a major energy consumer, but a comprehensive overview of the adaptive response to fasting is lacking. Gene-expression profiling, pathway analysis, and immunohistochemistry were therefore carried out on mouse small intestine after 0, 12, 24, and 72 hours of fasting. Results; Intestinal weight declined to 50% of control, but this loss of tissue mass was distributed proportionally among the gut s structural components, so that the microarrays tissue base remained unaffected. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the microarrays revealed that the successive time points separated into distinct branches. Pathway analysis depicted a pronounced, but transient early response that peaked at 12 hours, and a late response that became progressively more pronounced with continued fasting. Early changes in gene expression were compatible with a cellular deficiency in glutamine and metabolic adaptations directed at glutamine conservation, inhibition of pyruvate oxidation, stimulation of glutamate catabolism via aspartate and phosphoenolpyruvate to lactate, and enhanced fatty-acid oxidation and ketone-body synthesis. In addition, the expression of key genes involved in cell cycling and apoptosis was suppressed. At 24 hours of fasting, many of the early adaptive changes abated. Major changes upon continued fasting implied the production of glucose rather than lactate from carbohydrate backbones, a downregulation of fatty-acid oxidation and a very strong downregulation of the electron-transport chain. Cell cycling and apoptosis remained suppressed. Conclusion; The changes in gene expression indicate that the small intestine rapidly looses mass during fasting to generate lactate or glucose and ketone bodies. Meanwhile, intestinal architecture is maintained by downregulation of cell turnover. Experiment Overall Design: Male FVB mice (Charles River, Maastricht, The Netherlands) were housed at 20-22 C, 50-60% humidity, a 12 hours light/dark cycle, and food and water ad libitum. At 6 weeks of age, mice were fasted by removing chow for up to 72 hours before sacrifice (n = 6 per group). The animals were kept in metabolic cages to prevent the consumption of beddings and were kept warm with an infrared lamp starting at 24h. Experiment Overall Design: All animals were sacrificed between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. by cervical dislocation. The small intestine was removed quickly in such a way that adherent tissue remained behind. It was opened longitudinally, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, blotted, weighed, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 C. We opted to use extracts of full-thickness intestine for gene-expression profiling, because the epithelial component of the murine small intestine comprises over 70% of its volume The suitability of this strategy is underscored by a recent microarray study of transporters in the mouse intestine [Anderle P et al., BMC Genomics 2005, 6: 69.]. In addition, isolation of enterocytes is time-consuming and, hence, entails a risk of mRNA degradation, while mucosal scraping harvests villi more efficiently than crypts , whereas many mRNAs are most abundant in the crypts. Experiment Overall Design: Total intestinal RNA was extracted from frozen tissue with guanidiniumthiocyanate [Chomczynski P, Sacchi N: Analytical Biochemistry 1987, 162: 156-159.], followed by cesium-chloride centrifugation [Glisin V, Crkvenjakov R BC: Biochemistry 1974, 13: 2633-2637.] to avoid contamination with mucus. The quality of RNA was assessed with the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit in an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA). Microarray-based quantification of 8 mRNAs with a 1.3-9.2-fold change in expression was validated by qPCR, as described [58]. mRNA concentration was calculated using the LinReg program [59]. In the absence of reverse transcriptase, the signal was < 0.1% of that in its presence for each primer pair (not shown). Experiment Overall Design: Microarrays. The 60-mer Mouse Development (22K) Oligo Microarray G4120A (Agilent) was used. Three arrays per experimental condition were used. Per microarray, 20 g mRNA, pooled from 2 intestines, was reverse transcribed with Cy3-labelled dCTP (Perkin Elmer, Boston, USA), using the Agilent Fluorescent Direct Label Kit. Cy5-labeled cDNA produced from RNA pooled from 6 fed animals served as the common reference across all arrays (Figure 1A). Hybridized cDNAs were detected with Agilent s dual-laser microarray slide scanner. The data were retrieved with Agilent s Feature Extraction software 6.1.1.

Description
	
Lhx8 is a member of the LIM-homeobox transcription factor family and preferentially expressed in oocytes and germ cells within the mouse ovary. We discovered that Lhx8 knockout females lose oocytes within 7 days after birth. At the time of birth, histological examination shows that Lhx8 deficient (Lhx8(-/-)) ovaries are grossly similar to the newborn wild type ovaries. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries fail to maintain the primordial follicles and the transition from primordial to growing follicles does not occur. Lhx8(-/-) ovaries misexpress oocyte-specific genes such as Gdf9, Pou5f1, and Nobox. Very rapid loss of oocytes may partly be due to drastic the down-regulation of Kit and Kitl in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries. We compared Lhx8(-/-) and wild-type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. Eighty (44%) of 180 of the genes down-regulated more than 5-fold in Lhx8(-/-) ovaries were preferentially expressed in oocytes, whereas only 3 (2%) of 146 genes up-regulated more than 5-fold in the absence of Lhx8 were preferentially expressed in oocytes. In addition, the comparison of genes regulated in Lhx8(-/-) and Nobox(-/-) newborn ovaries discovered a common set of 34 genes whose expression level is affected in both Lhx8 and Nobox deficient mice. Our findings show that Lhx8 is a critical factor for maintenance and differentiation of the oocyte during early oogenesis and it acts in part by down-regulating the Nobox pathway. This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series:; GSE7774: Transcriptional changes in Lhx8 Null newborn mouse ovaries; GSE7775: Microarray Analyses of Newborn Mouse Ovaries Lacking Nobox; GSE7776: Ovarian Transcript Expression in Newborn Mouse Experiment Overall Design: Refer to individual Series

Description
	
MOLT4 cells in log phase (1x106 cells/ml) were pre-treated for 2 hours with the I?B? phosphorylation inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (Calbiochem) at 5?M, and the control samples with corresponding volume of DMSO. Cells were then irradiated with 4 Gy at room temperature, at a dose rate of 2.45 Gy/minute with a 137Cs ?-irradiator. Cells were harvested 2 hours after irradiation and RNA was extracted (Trizol; Invitrogen). RNA and cRNA quantity and quality was determined by Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent). Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays were hybridized as standard (www.affymetrix.co.uk). Array quality was determined using R and Affymetrix Expression Console file values. We then calculated a Z-score which represents the degree to which BAY 11-7082 reduces irradiation-induced transcription of all target genes.

Description
	
To achieve faithful replication of the genome once in each cell cycle, re-initiation of S-phase is prevented in G2 and origins are restricted from re-firing within S-phase. We have investigated the block to re-replication during G2 in fission yeast. The DNA synthesis that occurs when G2/M cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) activity is depleted has been assumed to be repeated rounds of S-phase without mitosis but this has not been demonstrated to be the case. In a normal mitotic S-phase, the genome is uniformly replicated with no areas amplified relative to other regions, so there is an equal copy number of each portion of the genome. To determine whether equal rounds of replication or local amplification occurred in the cdc13 s/o strain we assayed genomic DNA from cells which had increased their DNA content to 16C-32C. Using microarrays, we measured the relative DNA content across the genome, using DNA from control G1-arrested cells as a reference. This experiment revealed that replication was essentially equal across the genome, with no region becoming significantly amplified to a higher copy number than any other. Since the genome was found to be essentially evenly replicated as would be expected if each round of replication corresponded to a normal S-phase, we investigated whether this was the result of a normal replication program at the level of origin firing. We asked whether S-phase origins are used to reduplicate the genome, and whether origins are used with the same efficiency as in wild type cells. We identified the origins utilized in the first endoreduplication cycle of cdc13 s/o using microarray analyses of cells treated with 11 mM HU. Samples were taken at 5 hours when most cells of the culture not treated with HU had undergone a doubling in DNA content. A total of 799 origins were identified, a number roughly similar to the 904 identified in a normal S-phase. We show here that on G2/M CDK depletion in G2, repeated S-phases are induced. Mostly normal mitotic S-phase origins were utilized although at different efficiencies, and replication was essentially equal across the genome. We conclude that CDK inhibits re-initiation of S-phase during G2, and if G2/M CDK is depleted replication results from induction of a largely normal S-phase program with only small differences in origin usage and efficiency.

Description
	
Glucocorticoid responsive AIED patients demonstrate alternate splicing of IL1R2 in response to dexamethasone prior to treatment. Identification of IL1R2 as a potential target gene in AIED was determined by a microarray analysis of patients with end-stage AIED and controls with non-immunologic etiologies of hearing loss undergoing cochlear implantation. Experiment Overall Design: Patients with either end-stage AIED or controls with non-immunologic etiologies of hearing loss undergoing cochlear implantation were enrolled. All patients received pneumovax 2 weeks prior to surgery. At the time of surgery, blood was taken for PBMC isolation and autologous perilymph was harvested from a bloodless field. For each patient, 3 microarrays were performed: (1) unstimulated PBMC, (2) pneumovax stimulated PBMC, (3) autologous perilymph stimulated PBMC. All conditions were compared for the AIED and control subjects. IL1R2 was identified as induced in controls, but not AIED patients, in response to autologous perilymph. Findings were confirmed by QPCR.

Description
	
Disruption of the mouse gene encoding the gap junction subunit alpha3 connexin 46 (Cx46) results in the formation of lens cataracts. The timing of the onset of this lens opacity is affected by the genetic background, i.e. the mouse strain. To elucidate the mechanism by which cataracts form in the 129Sv/Jae strain earlier than in the C57BL/6J strain, global gene expression was quantitated in the lenses of these strains. Lens cDNAs were analyzed by hybridization to DNA microarrays and with real time-PCR. Theories are proposed based on the observed higher level of expression of the stress-response genes in the C57BL/6J strain and variations in the expression levels of genes involved in protein synthesis, metabolism, catabolism and cell proliferation. How these variations in gene expression might affect the response of lens fiber cells to the increased calcium, caused by lack of alpha3Cx46, is considered. The possibility that the proteins coded by the strain-variable genes might influence the cataract-associated proteolysis of gamma-crystallin is also addressed. Experiment Overall Design: To determine differences in transcript expression between the lenses of two mouse wild type strains (129 SvJae and C57BL/6J), as well as between alpha3Cx46 KO and wild-type mice. The former comparison may lead to identification of potential candidate(s) genes that prevent (or promote) cataract formation, whereas the latter comparison may provide insights into the mechanism by which cataract formation occurs in the alpha3Cx46 KO mice. Total 8 samples were used ( two separate samples for each of the following 4 types of mice: 129SvJae wild type, 129SvJae alpha3Cx46 KO, C57BL/6J wild type and C57BL/6J alpha3Cx46 KO)

Description
	
This study examined the genes under the control of FlhDC and sigmaF in E. coli. Experiment Overall Design: Under defined steady-state growth condition, we used two different genetic approaches to alter the modulator concentration in cells; (1) moderately expressing FlhDC or sigmaF from anhydrotetracycline (aTc) inducible and Tet repressor-controlled PLtet promoter in a plasmid-borne flhDC or fliA gene; (2) disrupting the expression of FlhDC or sigmaF in flhDC or fliA deletion mutant strains. Samples were taken from culture with wild-type or deletion strains at mid log phase (OD=0.2) or from overexpression strains at mid log phase (OD=0.2) before or 5 minutes after moderate induction. Samples were then RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent (Qiagen). Total RNA was then isolated using MasterPure kits (Epicentre Technologies). Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Arrays as recommended in the technical manual (www.affymetrix.com).

The transcriptome of murine LC after 24 hours in vivo exposure to a moderate dose of 10 microgram 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was studied. It was found that mice, although they express the arylhydrocarbon receptor abundantly in LC, are inert to its activation. Target genes are not inducible, in contrast to many other cell types. Experiment Overall Design: i.p. injection, isolation of cells after 24 hours, 95% sorting purity of LC.

Description
	
In this study we used the Affymetrix Barley 1 GeneChip to investigate transcriptome responses of barley cv. Dicktoo to low temperature, including triplicated measurements of cold, freeze/thaw cycles and de-acclimation over 33 days. Experiment Overall Design: Plants were grown at 20 C for seven days and subject to a symmetrical cycle of acclimation, cold, freeze-thaw, and deacclimation. Chilling began by decreasing the temperature overnight from 20 C to 4 C at a rate of 1.3 C h-1 and maintaining temperatures of 4 C in the day and 2 C at night for 5 days. Freeze-thaw cycling lasted 12 days with day temperatures of 4 C and night temperatures gradually decreasing from -2 C the first night to -4 C for three nights and -10 C for four nights, then recovering to -4 C for three nights and -2 C for one night. This treatment was designed to allow daily freeze-thaw cycling and protein synthesis. Chilling conditions (4 C day, 2 C night) were resumed for five days, followed by deacclimation with increasing temperature to 20 C overnight and maintaining for three days. Sampling was done at four different times, each at the 11th hour of light to avoid circadian effects: 1) before chilling treatment, 2) five days after initiation of chilling treatment, 3) eight days into freeze-thaw treatment and 4) three days into de-acclimation.

Description
	
Pertussis Toxin (PTX) regulated inflammatory and angiogenesis-related transcripts in endothelial cells from mouse brain(MBEC). Of ~14,000 mouse genes tracked, 34 showed altered expression in response to PTX, and most of these changes were dependent on the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the S1 subunit of the active holotoxin. More than one third of these genes have roles in inflammation and angiogenesis. Experiment Overall Design: MBEC(passage1) cultured on collagen-coated glass chamber slides were treated with PTX and B-oligomer at 3ng/ml, or PBS as control. Six hours later, total RNA were isolated from the cells. Gene microarray were performed to identify early candidate genes that are affected by PTX. The experiment was repeated twice independently.

Description
	
We have demonstrated previously that mammalian sexual differentiation requires both GATA4 and FOG2 transcription regulators to assemble the functioning testis. We have now determined that the sexual development of female mice is profoundly affected by the loss of GATA4-FOG2 interaction. We have also identified the Dkk1 gene, encoding a secreted inhibitor of canonical -catenin signaling as a target of GATA4/FOG2 repression in the developing ovary. The tissue-specific ablation of the -catenin gene in the gonads disrupts female development while in the Gata4ki/ki/Dkk1-/- or Fog2-/-/Dkk1-/- embryos the normal ovarian gene expression pattern is partially restored. Control of ovarian development by the GATA4/FOG2 complex presents a novel insight into the crosstalk of transcriptional regulation and extracellular signaling in ovarian development. Experiment Overall Design: 6 control and 6 Gata4ki/ki mutant samples were analyzed

Description
	
SOX genes encode a family of high-mobility group transcription factors that play critical roles in organogenesis. Virtually all members of SOX family have been found to be deregulated in tumors of various origins. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular behaviours involved in the oncogenic potential of SOX proteins. Cell culture experiments, tissue analysis, and molecular profiling revealed that SOX2 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis through its transcription regulation of cell cycle related genes in breast cancer cells Experiment Overall Design: To delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the cell proliferation and tumorigenic properties of SOX2, we investigated the gene expression profile in MCF-7 cells. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 and Human SOX2 expression constructs respectively. 24 hours after transfection, total RNA collected from control and SOX2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells was used to probe Human Genome GeneChip array U133 Plus 2.0

Description
	
Radiotherapy is widely used to treat human cancer. Patients locally recurring after radiotherapy, however, have increased risk of metastatic progression and poor prognosis. The clinical management of post-radiation recurrences remains an unresolved issue. Tumors growing in pre-irradiated tissues have an increased fraction of hypoxic cells and are more metastatic, a condition known as tumor bed effect. Here we demonstrate that tumor cells growing in a pre-irradiated bed, or selected in vitro though repeated cycles of severe hypoxia, retain an invasive and metastatic capacities when returned to normoxia. HIF activity, while it facilitates metastatic spreading of tumors growing in a pre-irradiated bed, is not essential. Through gene expression profiling and gain and loss of function experiments, we identified the matricellular protein CYR61 and aVb5 integrin, as proteins cooperating to mediate these effects. Inhibition of aVb5 integrin suppressed invasion and metastasis induced by CYR61 and attenuated metastasis of tumors growing within a pre-irradiated field. These results represent a conceptual advance to the understanding of the tumor bed effect and identify CYR61 and aVb5 integrin as proteins that co-operate to mediate metastasis. They also indicate aV integrin inhibition a potential therapeutic approach for preventing metastasis in patients at risk for post-radiation recurrences, which can be promptly tested in the clinic. Experiment Overall Design: The overall experimental design consist of a single channel experiment where a total of 9 independent samples of 3 different conditions were analyzed. The SCCVII murine cell line were grown either in an iradiadiated (IR) or non-irradiated (NIR) environment. The parental cell line (PA) was also hybridized as control.

Low-dose macrolides are effective therapy in patients with chronic lung infections, but the mechanisms of action are unclear. We compared global gene expression profiles between P.aeruginosa with and without low-dose Azithromycin (AZM) to study why the low-dose macrolide therapy is effective for cystic fibrosis and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Experiment Overall Design: Overnight culture of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 was inoculated at 1:100 into fresh LB medium. Various concentrations of AZM (0, 0.5, 2 ug/ml) were added to th culture media. Cells were collected 9 hours after the addition of AZM, and total RNA was isolated for DNA microarray experiments.

Description
	
Recent studies have highlighted the role of adrenal corticosteroid signaling in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. It is known that glucocorticoids and aldosterone are able to bind glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and these ligand-receptor interactions are redundant. Therefore, it has been impossible to delineate how these nuclear receptors couple with corticosteroid ligands and differentially regulate gene expression for operation of their distinct functions in the heart. Here, to particularly define the role of GR, we applied ligand-based approach involving GR-specific agonist cortivazol (CVZ) and GR antagonist RU486, and performed microarray analysis using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. We indicated that glucocorticoids appear to be a major determinant of GR-mediated gene expression when compared with aldosterone. Moreover, expression profiles of these genes highlighted numerous roles of glucocorticoids in various aspects of cardiac physiology. Experiment Overall Design: We analyzed gene expression changes after exposure of cells to corticosterone (COR), aldosterone (ALD), and cortivazol (CVZ) in the absence or presence of GR antagonist RU486. Since our preliminary experiments using several cell lines showed that expression of many GR target genes was induced by glucocorticoids in 3 h and to avoid secondary effects of the products of GR-regulated genes, we in the present study set the time periods of exposure to these ligands as 3 h. DNA microarray experiments were performed twice with the same protocol except for RU486 treatment.

Description
	
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) predisposes patients to leukemia and lymphoma. WAS is caused by mutations in the protein WASP which impair its interaction with the WIPF1 protein. Here, we aim to identify a module of WIPF1-coexpressed genes and to assess its use as a prognostic signature for colorectal cancer, glioma, and breast cancer patients. Two public colorectal cancer microarray data sets were used for discovery and validation of the WIPF1 co-expression module. Based on expression of the WIPF1 signature, we classified more than 400 additional tumors with microarray data from our own experiments or from publicly available data sets according to their WIPF1 signature expression. This allowed us to separate patient populations for colorectal cancers, breast cancers, and gliomas for which clinical characteristics like survival times and times to relapse were analyzed. Groups of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and glioma patients with low expression of the WIPF1 co-expression module generally had a favorable prognosis. In addition, the majority of WIPF1 signature genes are individually correlated with disease outcome in different studies. Literature gene network analysis revealed that among WIPF1 co-expressed genes known direct transcriptional targets of c-myc, ESR1 and p53 are enriched. The mean expression profile of WIPF1 signature genes is correlated with the profile of a proliferation signature. The WIPF1 signature is the first microarray-based prognostic expression signature primarily developed for colorectal cancer that is instrumental in other tumor types: low expression of the WIPF1 module is associated with better prognosis. We used microarrays for the validation of a WIPF1 co-expression module which was developed on two publically available datasets. Experiment Overall Design: For the generation of our own microarray data set, 62 CRC patients undergoing elective standard oncological resection at the Department of General, Vascular and Thoracic Surgery, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charit , were prospectively recruited.

Description
	
Microarray data allowed detection of genes that are highly expressed in the pineal gland. Experiment Overall Design: Adult Tg(aanat2:EGFP)Y8 transgenic zebrafish in which EGFP marks the pineal gland were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Fish were anesthetized in 1.5 mM Tricane (Sigma) and sacrificed by decapitation, and pineal glands were removed under a fluorescent dissecting microscope. Since the pineal gland is a clock-containing organ and levels of certain transcripts may vary throughout the circadian cycle, glands were collected throughout the 24-hr cycle at 4 hr intervals. During the 24-hr cycle the fish were either maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (LD) or kept in constant darkness (DD). 12 pineal glands were collected and pooled at each time point at each light condition, and total RNA was extracted (RNeasy, Qiagen).

Description
	
SPARC is a matricellular glycoprotein involved in regulation of the extracellular matrix, growth factors, adhesion, and migration. SPARC-null mice have altered basement membranes and develop posterior sub-capsular cataracts with cell swelling and equatorial vacuoles. Exchange of fluid, nutrients, and waste products in the avascular lens is driven by a unique circulating ion current. Here we demonstrate that SPARC-null mouse lenses exhibit abnormal circulation of fluid, ion, and small molecules which leads to altered fluorescein distribution in vivo, loss of resting membrane polarization, and altered distribution of small molecules. Microarray analysis of SPARC-null lenses showed changes in gene expression of ion channels and receptors, matrix and adhesion genes, cytoskeleton, immune response genes, and cell signaling molecules. Our results demonstrate that the regulation of SPARC on cell-capsular matrix interactions can influence the circulation of fluid and ions in the lens, and the phenotype in the SPARC-null mouse lens is the result of multiple intersecting pathways. Experiment Overall Design: Lens epithelial cells from 7 lenses of littermate mice were isolated by laser capture microdissection. 3 wild-type lenses from 3 different mice and 4 knock-out lenses from 3 different mice were used as biological replicates.

Description
	
RNA was isolated from ectopically sFRP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells and control MDA-MB-231 cells and as well from tumor lysates arising from these cells as nude mouse xenograft. Gene expression profiles for these samples were investigated using Affymetrix arrays. Experiment Overall Design: MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were stably transfected with human sFRP1 encoding vector or empty vector as control. After the selection with antibiotics, three clones of MDA-MB-231/sFRP1 and three clones of MDA-MB-231/control were selected. These six clones were cultured individually in DMEM 10% FCS with 1mg/ml G-418. When cells reached 70-80% confluence, RNA was isolated from the cells. In parallel, the three clones of MDA-MB-231/sFRP1 and the three clones of MDA-MB-231/control were pooled respectively. One million of cells from each pool were suspended in 100ul PBS and injected to fat pads of female balb/c nude mice (6 mice were injected with MDA-MB-231/sFRP1 and 5 mice were injected with MDA-MB-231/control) to do a xenograft experiment. A few - several weeks after, mice were sacrificed when tumor reached a certain size, tumors were taken and RNA was isolated using trizol reagent.

Description
	
Deletion of the RPS6 gene in mouse liver results in the inhibition of 40S ribosome biogenesis and the failure of hepatocytes to enter S-phase following partial hepatectomy. This microarray experiment was designed to assess the effects of RPS6 deletion on the expression of genes involved in liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. Experiment Overall Design: RNA was isolated from mouse livers at different time-points following partial hepatectomy. Conditional deletion of the RPS6 gene was perfomed by injecting polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid in mice harbouring a floxed version of the RPS6 gene and a cre recombinase under the regulation of an interferon responsive promoter (MX-CRE). The mice used a control have also a floxed version of the RPS6 gene but lack the cre recombinaste transgene.

Description
	
As4.1 cells are a renin-expressing cell line commonly used to study the molecular regulation of the mouse renin gene. In the present study, the global gene expression profile was assessed in these cells under control conditions (VEHICLE) and after treatment with interleukin (IL) or hydrogen peroxide (HP), both of which negatively regulate mouse renin gene expression. Experiment Overall Design: For each experimental group, 2 separate cultures of As4.1 cells were used. Cells were treated with interleukin (IL), hydrogen peroxide (HP) or vehicle control (VEHICLE). Cellular RNA was prepared using conventional methods and quality was assessed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). All the microarray procedures were conducted at the University of Iowa DNA Core facility using standard Affymetrix protocols. In brief, approximately 5 ug of total RNA was used as input to a one-step amplification procedure to generate biotin-labeled RNA fragments for hybridization to the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array.

However, genes critical for establishing and/or for maintaining quiescence are largely unknown. The fission yeast S. pombe is found as an excellent model for studying this problem, because it becomes quiescent under nitrogen starvation. Here we characterize 610 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants, and identify 33 genes required for entry into and the maintenance of quiescence. These genes cover a broad range of cellular functions in the cytoplasm, membrane and the nucleus, encoding proteins for stress-responsive and cell cycle kinase signaling pathway, actin-bound and osmo-controlling endosome formation, RNA transcription, splicing and ribosome biogenesis, chromatin silencing, biosynthesis of lipid and ATP, cell wall and membrane morphogenesis, protein trafficking and vesicle fusion. We specifically highlight Fcp1, CTD phosphatase of RNA polymerase II, which differentially affects transcription of genes involved in quiescence and proliferation. We propose that the transcriptional role of Fcp1 is central to differentiate quiescence from proliferation. Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression profile under nitrogen rich or starved condition at 26 C or 37 C in WT (L972) or fcp1-452 ts mutant strain of fission yeast.

Description
	
EWS-FLI1 is a chimeric ETS transcription factor that is, due to a chromosomal rearrangement, specifically expressed in Ewing s sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) and is thought to be the initiating event in the development of the disease. Previous genomic profiling experiments have identified a number of EWS-FLI1 regulated genes and genes that discriminate ESFT from other sarcomas, but so far a comprehensive analysis of EWS-FLI1 dependent molecular functions characterizing this aggressive cancer is lacking. In this study a molecular function map of ESFT was constructed based on an integrative analysis of gene expression profiling experiments on a uniform microarray platform following EWS-FLI1 knockdown in a panel of five ESFT cell lines, and on gene expression data from the same platform of 59 primary ESFT tumors. Based on the assumption that EWS-FLI1 is the driving transcriptional force in ESFT pathogenesis, we predicted an inverse correlation of gene expression for EWS-FLI1 regulated genes between the putative tissue of origin and the cell lines under EWS-FLI1 knockdown conditions. Consistent with recent reports, mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC) were found to fit this hypothesis best and were therefore used as the reference tissue for the construction of the molecular function map in ESFT. The interrelations of molecular pathways were visualized by measuring the similarity among annotated gene functions by gene sharing. The molecular function map highlighted distinct clusters of activities for EWS-FLI1 regulated genes in ESFT and revealed a striking difference between EWS-FLI1 up- and down-regulated genes: EWS-FLI1 induced genes mainly belong to cell cycle regulation, proliferation and response to DNA damage, while repressed genes were associated with differentiation and cell communication. This study revealed that EWS-FLI1 combines by distinct molecular mechanisms two important functions of cellular transformation in one protein, growth promotion and differentiation blockage. By taking MPC as a reference tissue a significant EWS-FLI1 signature was discovered in ESFT that only partially overlapped with previously published EWS-FLI1 dependent gene expression patterns, identifying a series of novel targets for the chimeric protein in ESFT. Our results may guide target selection for future ESFT specific therapies. Experiment Overall Design: EWS-FLI1 knock down was performed by expressing specific siRNAs against EWS-FLI1 as small hairpin (sh) RNAs from pSUPER-based retroviral expression constructs in 5 different Ewing's sarcoma cell lines (WE68, SK-N-MC, TC252, STA-ET-1, STA-ET-7.2). As a negative control in each cell line, pSTNeg (Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Brunn am Gebirge, Austria) encoding a scrambled shRNA with no significant similarity to human sequences was used.

Description
	
The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR ) regulates responses to chemical or physical stress in part by altering expression of genes involved in proteome maintenance. Many of these genes are also transcriptionally regulated by heat shock (HS) through activation by HS factor-1 (HSF1). We hypothesized that there are interactions on a genetic level between PPAR and the HS response mediated by HSF1. Wild-type and PPAR -null mice were exposed to HS, the PPAR agonist WY-14,643 (WY), or both; gene and protein expression was examined in the livers of the mice 4 or 24 hrs after HS. Gene expression profiling identified a number of Hsp family members that were altered similarly in both mouse strains. However, most of the targets of HS did not overlap between strains. A subset of genes was shown by microarray and RT-PCR to be regulated by HS in a PPAR -dependent manner. HS also down-regulated a large set of mitochondrial genes specifically in PPAR -null mice that are known targets of PPARg co-activator 1 (PGC-1) family members. Pretreatment of PPAR -null mice with WY increased expression of PGC-1b and target genes and prevented the down-regulation of the mitochondrial genes by HS. A comparison of HS genes regulated in our dataset with those identified in wild-type and HSF1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts indicated that although many HS genes are regulated independently of both PPAR and HSF1, a number require both factors for HS responsiveness. These findings demonstrate that the PPAR genotype has a dramatic effect on the transcriptional targets of HS and support an expanded role for PPAR in the regulation of proteome maintenance genes after exposure to diverse forms of environmental stress including HS. Experiment Overall Design: total 24 samples, 3 per group, for controls and treated.

Description
	
Mitochondrial biogenesis is under the control of two different genetic systems: the nuclear genome (nDNA) and the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). mtDNA is a circular genome of 16.6 kb encoding 13 of the approximately 90 subunits that form the respiratory chain, the remaining ones being encoded by the nuclear genome (nDNA). Eukaryotic cells are able to monitor and respond to changes in mitochondrial function through alterations in nuclear gene expression, a phenomenon first defined in yeast and known as retrograde regulation. With this experiment we aimed to identify the set of nuclear genes that significantly change their expression level in response to depletion of mtDNA. Experiment Overall Design: We used Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips to study the transcriptome of two human cell lines, 143BTK- and A549, which had been entirely depleted of mtDNA (rho0 cells), and compared it with the corresponding undepleted parental cells (rho+ cells). Three independent biological replicates were analyzed for each cell line and treatment group.

Description
	
Background: Constant hypoxia (CH) and intermittent hypoxia (IH) occur during several pathological conditions such as asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. Our research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that lead to injury or adaptation to hypoxic stress using Drosophila as a model system. Our current genome-wide study is designed to investigate gene expression changes and identify protective mechanism(s) in D. melanogaster after exposure to severe (1% O2) intermittent or constant hypoxia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Our microarray analysis has identified multiple gene families that are up- or down-regulated in response to acute CH or IH. We observed distinct responses to IH and CH in gene expression that varied in the number of genes and type of gene families. We then studied the role of candidate genes (up-or down-regulated) in hypoxia tolerance (adult survival) for longer periods (CH-7 days, IH-10 days) under severe CH or IH. Heat shock proteins up-regulation (specifically Hsp23 and Hsp70) led to a significant increase in adult survival (as compared to controls) of P-element lines during CH. In contrast, during IH treatment the up-regulation of Mdr49 and l(2)08717 genes (P-element lines) provided survival advantage over controls. This suggests that the increased transcript levels following treatment with either paradigm play an important role in tolerance to severe hypoxia. Furthermore, by over-expressing Hsp70 in specific tissues, we found that up-regulation of Hsp70 in heart and brain play critical role in tolerance to CH in flies. Conclusions/Significance: We observed that the gene expression response to IH or CH is specific and paradigm-dependent. We have identified several genes Hsp23, Hsp70, CG1600, l(2)08717 and Mdr49 that play an important role in hypoxia tolerance whether it is in CH or IH. These data provide further clues about the mechanisms by which IH or CH lead to cell injury and morbidity or adaptation and survival. Experiment Overall Design: Expression profiles were determined by expression arrays in Drosophila melanogaster following acute constant or intermittent hypoxia. Three groups of samples were included in this analysis (3 x control, 3x CH treated and 3 x IH treated samples).

Description
	
Objectives: To identify similarities and differences in gene expression data in the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways and to determine how histone modification affects these same pathways. Goal: To identify and functionally characterize novel targets of these signaling pathways in the context of chondrocyte differentiation. Experiment Overall Design: Cartilage derived from the hind limbs of CD1 mice staged at 15.5 days of embryonic development were dissected and plated in primary chondrocyte monolayer cultures. Cells were treated with MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors (SB202190 and UO126), a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (Trichostatin A) and the vehicle control (DMSO) for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated from these samples and hybridized to Affymetrix MOE 430 2.0 chips at the London Regional Genomics facility. Experiment Overall Design: A total of 15 genechips were analyzed between 4 treatments and the vehicle (DMSO) control. Three biological replicates per treatment were executed.

Description
	
This study describes a temporal profile of gene expression from normal human fetal testes and ovaries. Gonads from 34 fetuses between 9 weeks and 20 weeks of gestation were obtained from the Department of Pathology and the Birth Defects Research Laboratory at the University of Washington. Relative transcript levels were determined using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Plus 2.0 arrays. Sex determination occurs in the human gonad at approximately 6 weeks; gestation with development of the testis driven by expression of SRY. In this study, SRY transcript was present and elevated at 9 weeks gestation in the testis but absent in the ovary. The transcript levels of other testis-specific factors SOX9, AMH, and the steroidogenic genes CYP17a1, CYP11a1, STAR and HSD17 3 were all significantly higher in the testis. In contrast, transcripts known to be involved in meiosis including STRA8, SPO11, SYCP3, TEX11, TEX14 and STAG3 showed highest expression in the fetal ovary beginning at week 12. These gene expression profiles will be a resource for understanding and defining normal gonad development and provide the opportunity to dissect abnormal development. Experiment Overall Design: Gonads from 34 fetuses between 9 weeks and 20 weeks of gestation were obtained, total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.

Description
	
Identification of genes expressed in a preferential manner in the developing ciliary body/iris will provide a starting point for future functional analyses. To identify candidate genes expressed in a variety of ocular tissues during development, we have profiled single cells from the developing eye. Post hoc identification of the origin of these cells showed that they included cells from the periphery of the developing optic cup. By comparing the expression profiles of these cells to many retinal cell types, candidate genes for preferential expression in the periphery were identified. Experiment Overall Design: Single retinal cells were isolated in tubes containing lysis buffer, their mRNAs were reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were PCR amplified for 35 cycles. Labeled cDNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarrays and the data was normalized using MAS5.0 software. Since the retinal cells isolated during these developmental times had not yet adopted their mature morphologies, a post hoc strategy was employed to classify each cell based upon the expression of clusters of genes (Trimarchi et al., 2008). This classification method allowed for the identification of 21 single cells as developing retinal ganglion (RGC), amacrine (AC) or photoreceptor cells (PR) (Trimarchi et al., 2007) and an additional 42 cells as cycling RPCs (Trimarchi et al., 2008). However, a number of the single cells did not score significantly for any of the retinal cell types. Two cells in particular expressed genes that suggested these cells originated from the developing ciliary body/iris region.
